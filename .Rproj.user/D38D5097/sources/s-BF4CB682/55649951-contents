## Learning goals
* `R` tools for visualizing and analyzing data
 - exploration of `tidyverse` 
 - `dplyr`, `tidyr` and `readr` for data wrangling and organization
 - `ggplot2` for visualization
 - specific packages and functions for statistical analysis

* Theory to perform statistical inference
 - assumptions of different methods
 - hypothesis testing
 - estimation of parameters
 - model building and selection
 
* Avoiding common errors
 - when (not) to use a statistical method
 - sneaky paradoxes
 - phantom effects

* Work on your own data
 - analyze data
 - produce graphics
 - write up a report
 - present to class

## Approach

* Mix of theory and practice
* Apply what you're learning to your own data
