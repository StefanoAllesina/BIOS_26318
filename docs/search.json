First, one could use point-and-click software with a graphical user interface, such as Excel, to perform calculations and draw graphs; second, one could write programs that can be run to perform the analysis of the data, the generation of tables and statistics, and the production of figures automatically.\nThis latter approach is to be preferred, because it allows for the automation of analysis, it requires a good documentation of the procedures, and is completely replicable.\nA few motivating examples:\n\nYou have written code to analyze your data. You receive from your collaborators a new batch of data. With simple modifications of your code, you can update your results, tables and figures automatically.\nA new student joins the laboratory. The new student can read the code and understand the analysis without the need of a lab mate showing the procedure step-by-step.\nThe reviewers of your manuscript ask you to slightly alter the analysis. Rather than having to start over, you can modify a few lines of code and satisfy the reviewers.\n\nHere we introduce R, which can help you write simple programs to analyze your data, perform statistical analysis, and draw beautiful figures.",

This means that one can write a program (script) containing a series of commands for the analysis of data, and execute them automatically. This approach is especially good as it makes the analysis of data well-documented, and completely replicable.\nR is free software: anyone can download its source code, modify it, and improve it. The R community of users is vast and very active. In particular, scientists have enthusiastically embraced the program, creating thousands of packages to perform specific types of analysis, and adding many new capabilities. You can find a list of official packages (which have been vetted by R core developers) here; many more are available on GitHub and other websites.\nThe main hurdle new users face when approaching R is that it is based on a command line interface: when you launch R, you simply open a console with the character &gt; signaling that R is ready to accept an input. When you write a command and press Enter, the command is interpreted by R, and the result is printed immediately after the command. For example,\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA little history: R was modeled after the commercial statistical software S by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka.

    "section": "How to write a simple program",
    "text": "How to write a simple program\nAn R program is simply a list of commands, which are executed one after the other. The commands are written in a text file (with extension .R). When R executes the program, it will start from the beginning of the file and proceed toward the end of the file. Every time R encounters a command, it will execute it. Special commands can modify this basic flow of the program by, for example, executing a series of commands only when a condition is met, or repeating the execution of a series of commands multiple times.\nNote that if you were to copy and paste (or type) the code into the Console you would obtain exactly the same result. Writing a program is advantageous, however, because the analysis can be automated, and the code shared with other researchers. Moreover, after a while you will have a large code base, so that you can recycle much of your code.\nWe start by working on the console, and then start writing simple scripts.\n\nThe most basic operation: assignment\nThe most basic operation in any programming language is the assignment. In R, assignment is marked by the operator &lt;- (can be typed quickly using Alt -). When you type a command in R, it is executed, and the output is printed in the Console. For example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf we want to save the result of this operation, we can assign it to a variable. For example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat has happened? We wrote a command containing an assignment operator (&lt;-). R has evaluated the right-hand-side of the command (sqrt(9)), and has stored the result (3) in a newly created variable called x. Now we can use x in our commands: every time the command needs to be evaluated, the program will look up which value is associated with the variable x, and substitute it. For example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nData types\nR provides different types of data that can be used in your programs. For each variable x, calling class(x) prints the type of the variable. The basic data types are:\n\nlogical, taking only two possible values: TRUE and FALSE\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nnumeric, storing real numbers (actually, their approximations, as computers have limited memory and thus cannot store numbers like π, or even 0.2)\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nReal numbers can also be specified using scientific notation:\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\ninteger, storing whole numbers\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\ncomplex, storing complex numbers (i.e., with a real and an imaginary part)\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\ncharacter, for strings, characters and text\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn R, the value and type of a variable are evaluated at run-time. This means that you can recycle the names of variables. This is very handy, but can make your programs more difficult to read and to debug (i.e., find mistakes). For example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nOperators and functions\nEach data type supports a certain number of operators and functions. For example, numeric variables can be combined with + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and ^ (or **, exponentiation). A possibly unfamiliar operator is the modulo (%%), calculating the remainder of an integer division:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nmeaning that 5 %/% 3 (5 integer divided by 3) is 1 with a remainder of 2\nThe modulo operator is useful to determine whether a number is divisible for another: if y is divisible by x, then y %% x is 0.\nR provides many built-in functions: each functions has a name, followed by round parentheses surrounding the (possibly optional) function arguments. For example, these functions operate on numeric variables:\n\nabs(x) absolute value\nsqrt(x) square root\nround(x, digits = 3) round x to three decimal digits\ncos(x) cosine (also supported are all the usual trigonometric functions)\nlog(x) natural logarithm (use log10 for base 10 logarithms)\nexp(x) calculating \\(e^x\\)\n\nSimilarly, character variables have their own set of functions, such as:\n\ntoupper(x) make uppercase\nnchar(x) count the number of characters in the string\npaste(x, y, sep = \"_\") concatenate strings, joining them using the separator _\nstrsplit(x, \"_\") separate the string using the separator _\n\nCalling a function meant for a certain data type on another will cause errors. If sensible, you can convert a type into another. For example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf sensible, you can use the comparison operators &gt; (greater), &lt; (lower), == (equals), != (differs), &gt;= and &lt;=, returning a logical value:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nExercise:\nWhy are two equal signs (==) used to check that two values are equal? What happens if you use only one = sign?\n\nSimilarly, you can concatenate several comparison and logical variables using & (and), | (or), and ! (not):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nGetting help\nIf you want to know more about a function, type ?my_function_name in the console (e.g., ?abs). This will open the help page in one of the panels on the right. The same can be accomplished calling help(abs). For more complex questions, check out stackoverflow.\n\n\nData structures\nBesides these simple types, R provides structured data types, meant to collect and organize multiple values.\n\nVectors\nThe most basic data structure in R is the vector, which is an ordered collection of values of the same type. Vectors can be created by concatenating different values with the function c() (“combine”):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can access the elements of a vector by their index: the first element is indexed at 1, the second at 2, etc.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNA stands for “Not Available”. Other special values are NaN (Not a Number, e.g., 0/0), Inf (Infinity, e.g., 1/0), and NULL (variable undefined). You can test for special values using is.na(x), is.infinite(x), is.null(x), etc.\nNote that in R a single number (string, logical) is a vector of length 1 by default. That’s why if you type 3 in the console you see [1] 3 in the output.\nYou can extract several elements at once (i.e., create another vector), using the colon (:) command, or by concatenating the indices:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also use a vector of logical variables to extract values from vectors. For example, suppose we have two vectors:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nand that we want to extract only the weights for the males.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nreturns a vector of logical values, which we can use to subset the data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGiven that R was born for statistics, there are many statistical functions you can perform on vectors:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can generate vectors of sequential numbers using the colon command:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor more complex sequences, use seq:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo repeat a value or a sequence several times, use rep:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nExercise:\n\nCreate a vector containing all the even numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and store it in variable z.\nExtract all the elements of z that are divisible by 12. How many elements match this criterion?\nWhat is the sum of all the elements of z?\nIs it equal to \\(51 \\cdot 50\\)?\nWhat is the product of elements 5, 10 and 15 of z?\nDoes seq(2, 100, by = 2) produce the same vector as (1:50) * 2?\nWhat happens if you type z ^ 2?\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\nA matrix is a two-dimensional table of values. In case of numeric values, you can perform the usual operations on matrices (product, inverse, decomposition, etc.):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo determine the dimensions of a matrix, use dim:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUse indices to access a particular row/column of a matrix:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSome functions use all the elements of the matrix:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSome functions apply the operation across a given dimension (e.g., columns) of the matrix:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nArrays\nIf you need tables with more than two dimensions, use arrays:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can still determine the dimensions using:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nand access the elements as done for matrices. One thing you should be paying attention to: R drops dimensions that are not needed. So, if you access a “slice” of a 3-dimensional array:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nyou obtain a matrix:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis can be problematic, for example, when your code expects an array and R turns your data into a matrix (or you expect a matrix but find a vector). To avoid this behavior, add drop = FALSE when subsetting:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nLists\nVectors are good if each element is of the same type (e.g., numbers, strings). Lists are used when we want to store elements of different types, or more complex objects (e.g., vectors, matrices, even lists of lists). Each element of the list can be referenced either by its index, or by a label:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nData frames\nData frames contain data organized like in a spreadsheet. The columns (typically representing different measurements) can be of different types (e.g., a column could be the date of measurement, another the weight of the individual, or the volume of the cell, or the treatment of the sample), while the rows typically represent different samples.\nWhen you read a spreadsheet file in R, it is automatically stored as a data frame. The difference between a matrix and a data frame is that in a matrix all the values are of the same type (e.g., all numeric), while in a data frame each column can be of a different type.\nBecause typing a data frame by hand would be tedious, let’s use a data set that is already available in R:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nExercise:\n\nWhat is the average height of the cherry trees?\nWhat is the average girth of those that are more than 75 ft tall?\nWhat is the maximum height of trees with a volume between 15 and 35 ft\\(^3\\)?",

    "text": "Reading and writing data\nIn most cases, you will not generate your data in R, but import it from a file. By far, the best option is to have your data in a comma separated value text file or in a tab separated file. Then, you can use the function read.csv (or read.table) to import your data. The syntax of the functions is as follows:\n\nread.csv(\"MyFile.csv\") # read the file MyFile.csv\nread.csv(\"MyFile.csv\", header = TRUE) # the file has a header\nread.csv(\"MyFile.csv\", sep = ';') # specify the column separator\nread.csv(\"MyFile.csv\", skip = 5) # skip the first 5 lines\n\nNote that columns containing strings are typically converted to factors (categorical values, useful when performing regressions). To avoid this behavior, you can specify stringsAsFactors = FALSE when calling the function.\nSimilarly, you can save your data frames using write.table or write.csv. Suppose you want to save the data frame MyDF:\n\nwrite.csv(MyDF, \"MyFile.csv\") \nwrite.csv(MyDF, \"MyFile.csv\", append = TRUE) # append to the end of the file \nwrite.csv(MyDF, \"MyFile.csv\", row.names = TRUE) # include the row names\nwrite.csv(MyDF, \"MyFile.csv\", col.names = FALSE) # do not include column names\n\nLet’s look at an example: Read a file containing data on the 6th chromosome for a number of Europeans (Data adapted from Stanford HGDP SNP Genotyping Data by John Novembre).

Save the script by pressing Ctrl + S: save it as conditional.R in the directory programming_skills/sandbox/. To make sure you’re working in the directory where the script is contained, on the menu on the top choose Session -&gt; Set Working Directory -&gt; To Source File Location.\nNow type the following script:\n\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\nx &lt;- 4\nprint(x)\n\nand execute the script by pressing Ctrl + Shift + S. You should see Hello World! and 4 printed in your console.\nAs you saw in this simple example, when R executes the program, it starts from the top and proceeds toward the end of the file. Every time it encounters a command (for example, print(x), printing the value of x into the console), it executes it.\nWhen we want a certain block of code to be executed only when a certain condition is met, we can write a conditional branching point. The syntax is as follows:\n\nif (condition is met){\n  # execute this block of code\n} else {\n  # execute this other block of code\n}\n\nFor example, add these lines to the script conditional.R, and run it again:\n\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\nx &lt;- 4\nprint(x)\nif (x %% 2 == 0){\n  my_message &lt;- paste(x, \"is even\")\n} else {\n  my_message &lt;- paste(x, \"is odd\")\n}\nprint(my_message)\n\nWe have created a conditional branching point, so that the value of my_message changes depending on whether x is even (and thus the remainder of the integer division by 2 is 0), or odd.

    "title": "Refresher",
    "section": "Looping",
    "text": "Looping\nAnother way to change the flow of the program is to write a loop. A loop is simply a series of commands that are repeated a number of times. For example, you want to run the same analysis on different data sets that you collected; you want to plot the results contained in a set of files; you want to test your simulation over a number of parameter sets; etc.\nR provides you with two ways to loop over blocks of commands: the for loop, and the while loop. Let’s start with the for loop, which is used to iterate over a vector (or a list): for each value of the vector, a series of commands will be run, as shown by the following example, which you can type in a new script called forloop.R.\n\nmyvec &lt;- 1:10 # vector with numbers from 1 to 10\n\nfor (i in myvec) {\n  a &lt;- i ^ 2\n  print(a)\n}\n\nIn the code above, the variable i takes the value of each element of myvec in sequence. Inside the block defined by the for loop, you can use the variable i to perform operations.\nThe anatomy of the for statement:\n\nfor (variable in list_or_vector) {\n  execute these commands\n} # automatically moves to the next value\n\nFor loops are used when you know that you want to perform the analysis using a given set of values (e.g., run over all files of a directory, all samples in your data, all sequences of a fasta file, etc.).\nThe while loop is used when the commands need to be repeated while a certain condition is true, as shown by the following example, which you can type in a script called whileloop.R:\n\ni &lt;- 1\n\nwhile (i &lt;= 10) {\n  a &lt;- i ^ 2\n  print(a)\n  i &lt;- i + 1 \n}\n\nThe script performs exactly the same operations we wrote for the for loop above. Note that you need to update the value of i, (using i &lt;- i + 1), otherwise the loop will run forever (infinite loop—to terminate click on the stop button in the top-right corner of the console).

Here are some suggestions for finding an appropriate package. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) offers several ways to find specific packages for your task. You can either browse packages (goo.gl/7oVyKC) and their short description or select a scientific field of interest (goo.gl/0WdIcu) to browse through a compilation of packages related to each discipline.\nFrom within your R terminal or RStudio you can also call the function RSiteSearch(\"KEYWORD\"), which submits a search query to the website search.r-project.org. The website rseek.org casts an even wider net, as it not only includes package names and their documentation but also blogs and mailing lists related to R. If your research interests relate to high-throughput genomic data, you should have a look the packages provided by Bioconductor (goo.gl/7dwQlq).\n\nInstalling a package\nTo install a package type\n\ninstall.packages(\"name_of_package\")\n\nin the Console, or choose the panel Packages and then click on Install in RStudio.\n\n\nLoading a package\nTo load a package type\n\nlibrary(name_of_package)\n\nor call the command into your script.

Each block should be its own function.\nWrite the code for each building block separately, and test it thoroughly.\nExtensively document the code, so that you can understand what you did, how you did it, and why.\nCombine the building blocks into a master program.\n\nFor example, let’s write code that takes the data on Chromosome 6 we have seen above, and tries to identify which SNPs deviate the most from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Remember that in an infinite population, where mating is random, there is no selection and no mutations, the proportion of people carrying the alleles \\(A1A1\\) should be approximately \\(p_{11} = p^2\\) (where \\(p\\) is the frequency of the first allele in the population \\(p = p_{11} + \\frac{1}{2} p_{12}\\)), those carrying \\(A1A2\\) should be \\(p_{12} = 2 p q\\) (where \\(q = 1-p\\)) and finally those carrying \\(A2A2\\) should be \\(p_{22} = q^2\\). This is called the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nWe want to test this on a number of different SNPs.

Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984\n\nWhen doing experiments, we typically keep track of everything we do in a laboratory notebook, so that when writing the manuscript, or responding to queries, we can go back to our documentation to find exactly what we did, how we did it, and possibly why we did it. The same should be true for computational work.\nRStudio makes it very easy to build a computational laboratory notebook. First, create a new R Markdown file (choose File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown from the menu).\nThe gist of it is that you write a text file (.Rmd). The file is then read by an interpreter that transforms it into an .html or .pdf file, or even into a Word document. You can use special syntax to render the text in different ways. For example, type\n***********\n\n*Test* **Test2**\n\n# Very large header\n\n## Large header\n\n### Smaller header\n\n## Unordered lists\n\n* First\n* Second\n    + Second 1\n    + Second 2\n\n1.

    "text": "1.2 Introduction to the Grammar of Graphics\nThe most salient feature of scientific graphs should be clarity. Each figure should make crystal-clear a) what is being plotted; b) what are the axes; c) what do colors, shapes, and sizes represent; d) the message the figure wants to convey. Each figure is accompanied by a (sometimes long) caption, where the details can be explained further, but the main message should be clear from glancing at the figure (often, figures are the first thing editors and referees look at).\nMany scientific publications contain very poor graphics: labels are missing, scales are unintelligible, there is no explanation of some graphical elements. Moreover, some color graphs are impossible to understand if printed in black and white, or difficult to discern for color-blind people.\nGiven the effort that you put into your science, you want to ensure that it is well presented and accessible. The investment to master some plotting software will be rewarded by pleasing graphics that convey a clear message.\nIn this section, we introduce ggplot2, a plotting package for R This package was developed by Hadley Wickham who contributed many important packages to R (all included in the tidyverse bundle we’re going to use for the reminder of the class). Unlike many other plotting systems, ggplot2 is deeply rooted in a “philosophical” vision. The goal is to conceive a grammar for all graphical representation of data. Leland Wilkinson and collaborators proposed The Grammar of Graphics. It follows the idea of a well-formed sentence that is composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The Grammar of Graphics likewise aims at describing a well-formed graph by a grammar that captures a very wide range of statistical and scientific graphics. This might be more clear with an example – Take a simple two-dimensional scatterplot. How can we describe it? We have:\n\nData The data we want to plot.\nMapping What part of the data is associated with a particular visual feature? For example: Which column is associated with the x-axis? Which with the y-axis? Which column corresponds to the shape or the color of the points? In ggplot2 lingo, these are called aesthetic mappings (aes).\nGeometry Do we want to draw points? Lines? In ggplot2 we speak of geometries (geom).\nScale Do we want the sizes and shapes of the points to scale according to some value? Linearly? Logarithmically? Which palette of colors do we want to use?\nCoordinate We need to choose a coordinate system (e.g., Cartesian, polar).\nFaceting Do we want to produce different panels, partitioning the data according to one (or more) of the variables?\n\nThis basic grammar can be extended by adding statistical transformations of the data (e.g., regression, smoothing), multiple layers, adjustment of position (e.g., stack bars instead of plotting them side-by-side), annotations, and so on.\nExactly like in the grammar of a natural language, we can easily change the meaning of a “sentence” by adding or removing parts. Also, it is very easy to completely change the type of geometry if we are moving from say a histogram to a boxplot or a violin plot, as these types of plots are meant to describe one-dimensional distributions. Similarly, we can go from points to lines, changing one “word” in our code. Finally, the look and feel of the graphs is controlled by a theming system, separating the content from the presentation.",

    "text": "2.1 Sample spaces and random variables\nNo observation or measurement in our world is perfectly reproducible, no matter how carefully planned and executed. The level of uncertainly varies, but randomness always finds a way to creep into a data set. Where does the “random” factor come from? From the classical physics perspective, as articulated by Laplace, most natural phenomena are theoretically deterministic for an omniscient being with an unlimited computational power. Quantum mechanical phenomena are (theoretically) truly random, but the randomness is not observable on the scales of biology or social science. The lack of predictability in the data we work with is usually due either to its intrinsic complexity (e.g., bio-molecular systems, prediction of animal behavior), which essentially makes it impossible to know every detail of the system, or to some external source of noise (e.g., measurement error, weather affecting food availability) that is outside of our control.\nIn probability terminology, a random experiment produces outcomes and the collection of all outcomes of an experiment is called its sample space.\nExample: The specifics of the experiment can affect the degree of uncertainty in the outcome; the same measurement may be random or not, depending on context. For example, measuring the height of a person should be deterministic, if one measures the height of the same person within a short amount of time. So unless you’re interested in studying the error in stadiometer results, you probably won’t consider this a random experiment. However, measuring the heights of different people is a random experiment, where the source of randomness is primarily due to the selection of people for your study, called sampling error, rather than due to the measurement noise of any one person.\nThe measurement of interest from a random experiment is called a random variable. Sometimes the measurement is simply the outcome, but usually it reports some aspect of the outcome and so several outcomes can have the same value of the random variable. The random variable can then be seen as condensing the sample space into a smaller range of values. Random variables can be numeric or categorical, with the difference that categorical variables cannot be assigned meaningful numbers. For instance, one may report an individual by phenotype (e.g., white or purple flowers), or having a nucleotide A, T, G, C in a particular position, and although one could assign numbers to these categories (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) they could not be used in a sensible way—one can compare and do arithmetic with numbers, but A is not less than T and A + T does not equal G. Thus there are different tools for describing and working with numeric and categorical random variables.\nExample: In a DNA sequence a codon triplet represents a specific amino acid, but there is redundancy (several triplets may code for the same amino acid). One may think of a coding DNA sequence as an outcome, but the amino acid (sequence or single one) as a random variable. Extending this framework, one may think of genotype as an outcome, but a phenotype (e.g., eye color) as a random variable—although this is not correct for any phenotype that is not strictly determined by the genotype, because then there are other factors (e.g., environmental or epigenetic) that influence the value of the random variable besides the outcome (genotype).\nExercise: The package palmerpenguins contains multiple variables measured in populations of three different species of penguins over three years on three different islands. Identify numeric and categorical variables, and specify whether numeric variables are discrete and continuous.",

Combinations of outcomes (events) can be assigned probabilities by building them out of individual outcomes. These probabilities have a few rules, called the axioms of probability, expressed using set theory notation.\n\nThe total probability of all outcomes in sample space is 1. \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\)\nThe probability of nothing (empty set) is 0. \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\)\nThe probability of an event made up of the union of two events is the sum of the two probabilities minus the probability of the overlap (intersection.) \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\)\n\nExample: Let’s assign a probability to every possible three-letter codon. There are \\(4^3 = 64\\) codons, so if one assumes that each one has equal probability, then they they all equal \\(1/64\\) (by axiom 1.) The probability of a codon having A as the first letter is 1/4, and so is the probability of A as the second letter. Axiom 3 allows us to calculate the probability of A in either the first or the second letter:\n\\[ P(AXX \\cup \\ XAX ) =  P(AXX) + P(XAX) - P(AAX) = 1/4 + 1/4 - 1/16 = 7/16\\]",

    "text": "2.3 Probability distributions\nThe probability of each value of a random variable can be calculated from the probability of the event that corresponds to each value of the random variable. The collection of the probabilities of all of the values of the random variable is called the probability distribution function of the random variable, more formally the mass function for a discrete random variable or the density function for a continuous random variable.\nFor a discrete random variable (let’s call it \\(X\\)) with a probability mass function \\(f\\), the probability of \\(X\\) taking the value of \\(a\\) can be written either as \\(f(X=a)\\) or \\(f(a)\\), as long as it’s clear that \\(f\\) is the probability distribution function of \\(X\\). The one ironclad rule of probability is that all values of the mass function have to add up to 1. To state this mathematically, if all the possible values of \\(X\\) can be written as \\(a_1, a_2, ...\\) (there may be finitely or infinitely many of them, as long as it’s a countable infinity), this sum has to be equal to 1: \\[ \\sum_i f(a_i) = 1 \\]\nA continuous random variable (let’s call it \\(Y\\)) with a probability density function \\(g\\) is a bit more complicated. The continuous part means that the random variable has uncountably many values, even if the range is finite (for example, there are uncountably many real numbers between 0 and 1). Thus, the probability of any single value must be vanishingly small (zero), otherwise it would be impossible to add up (integrate) all of the values and get a finite result (let alone 1). We can only measure the probability of a range of values of \\(Y\\) and it is defined by the integral of the density function overall that range:\n\\[ P( a&lt; Y &lt; b) = \\int_a ^b g(y) dy \\]\nThe total probability over the entire range of \\(Y\\) has to be 1, but it’s similarly calculated by integration instead of summation (\\(R\\) represents the range of values of \\(Y\\)):\n\\[ \\int_R g(y) dy = 1\\]\nExample: As codons (DNA triplets) code for amino acids, we can consider the genetic code a random variable on the sample space. Assuming all codons have equal probabilities, the probability of each amino acid is the number of triplets that code for it divided by 64. For example, the probabilities of leucine and arginine are \\(6/64 = 3/32\\), the probability of threonine is \\(4/64 = 1/16\\) and the probabilities of methionine and tryptophan are \\(1/64\\). This defines a probability distribution function of the random variable of the genetic code. Note that the sum of all the probabilities of amino acids has to be 1. Of course there is no inherent reason why each triplet should be equally probable, so a different probability structure on the sample space would result in a different probability distribution (mass) function.",

    "text": "2.6 Data as samples from distributions: statistics\nIn scientific practice, we collect data from one or more random variables, called a sample, and then try to make sense of it. One of the basic goals is statistical inference: using the data set to describe the population distribution from which the sample was drawn. Data sets can be plotted as histograms and the frequency/fraction of each value should be an approximation of the underlying probability distribution. In addition, descriptive statistics of the sample data (means, variances, medians, etc.) can be used to estimate the true parameters such as the mean and the variance of the population distribution.\nSome of the fundamental questions about the population include:\n\nWhat type of distribution is it?\nEstimate the parameters of that distribution.\nTest a hypothesis, e.g., whether two samples were drawn from the same distribution.\nDescribe and test a relationship between two or more variables.\n\n\n2.6.1 Law of large numbers\nFirst, the sample has to be unbiased, that is, no outcomes should be systematically over- or under-represented. But even an unbiased sample will differ from the population due to the inherent randomness of selection (sampling error). The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the mean of the sample converges to the true mean of the population. Formally, for a set of \\(n\\) independent, identically distributed random variables (the sample) \\(\\{X_i\\}\\) the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) converges to the mean of the distribution \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[\n\\lim _{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n {X_i}}{n} = \\lim _{n \\to \\infty} \\overline{X}_n = \\mu\n\\]\n\n\n2.6.2 Central Limit Theorem\nThat is nice to know, but doesn’t say exactly how large a sample is needed to estimate, for example, the mean of the population to a given precision. For that, we have the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means (from samples of independent, identically distributed random variables) as sample size increases, approaches the normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean equal to the population mean and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. Formally, it states that for a set of \\(n\\) independent, identically distributed random variables (the sample) \\(\\{X_i\\}\\) with distribution mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), the probability density function of the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) converges for large sample size \\(n\\) to the normal distribution:\n\\[\nP(\\overline{X}_n) \\to N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\n\\]\nwhere \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n\\)) stands for the normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2/n\\). One extremely useful consequence of this theorem is that the variance of the sample mean is reciprocally related to the sample size \\(n\\). More precisely, it allows the calculation of confidence intervals by using the normal distribution to generate an interval around the observed sample mean in which the true mean \\(\\mu\\) lies with a given likelihood.\nThis is an amazing result because it applies to any distribution, so it allows for the estimation of means for any situation, as long as the condition of independent, identically distributed variables in the sample is satisfied (the identical distributed condition can actually be relaxed). There are other central limit theorems that apply to other situations, including cases where the random variables in the sample are not independent (e.g., Markov models). The bottom line is that an unbiased sample contains a reflection of the true population, but it is always distorted by uncertainty. Larger sample sizes decrease the uncertainty but are more difficult and expensive to obtain.\nDiscussion: Suggest examples of biological data sets which are not made up of independent identically distributed random variables.",

However, means can be misleading measures in multiple ways.\nFirst, means are highly sensitive to outliers, or points that are very different from other values. They can skew the mean value, even pulling it completely away from the bulk of the values, in which case the mean ceases to be a measure of a “typical” value.\nSecond, there can be funny business with combining means of different subsets of data. Normally, you might expect if you have group A and group B, and each group has two subgroups divided by another variable (e.g. we are comparing the GPAs of students in school A and school B, and we split up the students in each school by gender), then if the means of each subgroup of A and larger than the means of the same subgroup of B (e.g. the GPA of girls and boys in school A are higher than those of their counterparts in school B), then the same relationship should be true for the combined mean of group A and group B (that is, the overall GPA in school A is higher than school B). That is not necessarily true!\nThis apparent contradiction is called Simpson’s paradox. It can be illustrated in the data set of all the passengers and crew on the doomed ocean liner Titanic.

    "text": "4.2 Independence\n\n4.2.1 Conditional probability\nIn the basic definitions of probability, we considered the probabilities of each outcome and events separately. Let us consider how information about one event affects the probability of another event. The concept is that if one event (let’s call it \\(B\\)) is true, unless the event is the entire space, it rules out some other outcomes. This may affect the probability of other events (e.g., \\(A\\)) in the sample space, because knowledge of \\(B\\) may rule out some of the outcomes in \\(A\\) as well. Here is the formal definition:\n\nDefinition: For two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a sample space \\(\\Omega\\) with a probability measure \\(P\\), the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\), called the conditional probability, defined as:\n\n\\(P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\)\n\nwhere \\(A \\cap B\\) or \\(A, B\\) is the intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), also known as “\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)”—the event consisting of all outcomes that are in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nIn words, given the knowledge that an event \\(B\\) occurs, the sample space is restricted to the subset \\(B\\), which is why the denominator in the definition is \\(P(B)\\). The numerator encompasses all the outcomes we are interested in, (i.e., \\(A\\)), but since we are now restricted to \\(B\\), the numerator consists of all the outcomes of \\(A\\) which are also in \\(B\\), or \\(A \\cap B\\). The definition makes sense in two extreme cases: if \\(A = B\\) and if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive:\n\\(P(B\\vert B) = P(B \\cap B) /P(B) = P(B)/P(B) = 1\\)\nIf \\(P(A\\cap B) = 0\\), then \\(P(A\\vert B) = 0/P(B) = 0\\)\nImportant note: one common source of confusion about conditional probability is the difference between the probability of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) and the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\). This is a result of the discrepancy between everyday word usage and mathematical terminology, because the statement “what are the odds of finding a tall person who also likes tea?” is hard to distinguish from “what are the odds that a person who is tall likes tea?” The critical difference between these two statements is that in the former you start out with no information and are picking out a person from the entire population, while is in the latter you start out with the knowledge that a person is tall.\nExample: In the classic Mendelian pea experiment, each diploid organism carries two alleles. The allele \\(A\\) is dominant and results in pink flowers, while \\(a\\) is recessive and results in white flowers. There are three possible genotypes (\\(AA\\), \\(Aa\\), \\(aa\\)) and two phenotypes (Pink or White). For the questions below, assume that two heterozygous pea plants (each having genotype \\(Aa\\)) are crossed, producing the following table of genotypes with equal probabilities in each cell:\n\n\n\nparent\nA\na\n\n\n\n\nA\nAA (pink)\nAa (pink)\n\n\na\nAa (pink)\naa (white)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that a plant with pink flowers has genotype \\(AA\\)? Write this down in terms of conditional probability and explain how it’s different from the probability of a plant having both pink flower and genotype \\(AA\\).\nWhat is the probability that a plant with genotype \\(AA\\) has pink flowers? Again, write down the conditional probability and explain how it’s different from the probability of a plant having both pink flower and genotype \\(AA\\).\n\nLesson: in general, \\[P(X \\vert  Y ) \\neq P(Y \\vert  X)\\]\n\n\n4.2.2 Independence\nIndependence is a fundamental concept in probability that may be misinterpreted without careful thinking. Intuitively, two events (or random variables) are independent if one does not influence the other. More precisely, it means that the probability of one event is the same regardless of whether the other one happens or not. This is expressed precisely using conditional probabilities:\n\nDefinition: Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a sample space \\(\\Omega\\) with a probability measure \\(P\\) are independent if \\(P(A\\vert B) = P(A)\\), or equivalently if \\(P(B\\vert A) = P(B)\\).\n\nIndependence is not a straightforward concept. It may be confused with mutual exclusivity, as one might surmise that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have no overlap, then they are independent. That however, is false by definition, since \\(P(A\\vert B)\\) is 0 for two mutually exclusive events. The confusion stems from thinking that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are non-overlapping, then they do not influence each other. But the notion of influence in this definition is about information; so if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive, the knowledge that one of them occurs has an influence of the probability of the other one occurring, specifically it rules the other one out.\nExample: In the sample space of weather phenomena, are the events of snowing and hot weather independent?\nExample: A slightly more subtle example, the lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 1 in 8 for women and about 1 in 1000 for men. Are sex and breast cancer independent?\n\n\n4.2.3 Usefulness of independence\nIndependence is a mathematical abstraction, and reality rarely provides us with perfectly independent variables. But it’s a very useful abstraction in that it enables calculations that would be difficult or impossible to carry out without this assumption.\nFirst, independence allows for calculating the probability of two events or two random variables simultaneously. This is a straightforward consequence of the definition conditional probability (first equality) and independence (second equality):\n\\[\\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}= P(A\\vert B) = P(A)\\] Multiplying both sides by \\(P(B)\\), we get the product rule of independence, perhaps the most widely used formula in applied probability:\n\\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\]\nExample: The probability that two randomly selected individuals have red hair–assuming that the occurrence of this trait is independent–is the square of the probability of red hair in one individual. (Note that this is never exactly the case for a finite population—why?)\nExample: The probability of two alleles of two separate genes (call them A and B) occurring on the same gamete may be independent or may be linked. In population genetics, the concept of linkage disequilibrium describes the extent of such linkage; for example, alleles that are located on separate chromosomes (in eukaryotes) are usually not linked and their occurrence is independent. The coefficient of linkage disequilibrium is defined as the difference between what is expected from independence and the actual probability of both alleles being present: \\[D_{AB} = P(A \\cap B) - P(A)P(B) \\] \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\) are the frequencies of the two respective alleles (haplotypes) in the population, while \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) is the frequency of the haplotypes occurring together in the same copy of the genome (that is, on the same gamete). For two independent loci, \\(D_{AB} = 0\\), while for loci that usually occur together the coefficient will be positive, and its magnitude is influenced both by physical proximity of the loci on a chromosome, the evolutionary history of the species, and other factors.\nAnother important consequence of independence has to do with the sum of two independent random variables. The expectation of the sum of any random variables is linear, which can be demonstrated using some work with sums, starting from the definition of expectation (the same can be shown for continuous random variables, using integrals instead of sums):\n\\[E(X + Y) = \\sum_i \\sum_j (x_i + y_j) P(x_i, y_j) =\\]\n\\[= \\sum_i \\sum_j x_iP(x_i, y_j) + \\sum_i \\sum_j y_j P(x_i, y_j) = \\sum_i x_i \\sum_j P(x_i, y_j) + \\sum_j y_j \\sum_i  P(x_i, y_j) = \\] Summing up a joint probability distribution over all values of one variable removes that variable, \\(\\sum_j P(x_i, y_j) = P(x_i)\\) \\(\\sum_i P(x_i, y_j) = P(y_j)\\), so this leave us with the two separate expected values:\n\\[= \\sum_i x_i P(x_i) + \\sum_j y_j P(y_j) = E(X) + E(Y)\\] However, this is not the case for the variance in general (using \\(E_X\\) and \\(E_Y\\) to indicate the expected values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to reduce the number of parentheses):\n\\[\\text{Var}(X+Y) = E \\left[ (X+Y)-(E_X+E_Y) \\right]^2 = \\] \\[=E[ (X-E_X)^2 +(Y-E_Y)^2 - 2(X-E_X)(Y-E_Y)] =  \\] \\[=E (X-E_X)^2 +  E(Y-E_Y)^2 - 2 E[(X-E_X)(Y-E_Y)]  = \\] The first two terms are the respective variances, while the third term is called the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\):\n\\[= \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) - 2 \\text{Cov}(X,Y) \\] Covariance describes how much two random variables vary together, or more precisely, how much they deviate from their respective means in the same direction. Thus it should be reasonable to think that two independent random variables have covariance 0, which is demonstrated as follows:\n\\[E[(X-E_X)(Y-E_Y)] = E(XY) - E_Y E_X - E_YE_X + E_XE_Y = E(XY) - E_X E_Y  \\]\nWe can write the expression for the expectation of the random variable comprised of all pairs of values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), using the fact that for two independent random variables, \\(P(x_i,y_j) = P(x_i)P(y_j)\\) for all values \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_j\\):\n\\[E(XY) = \\sum_i \\sum_j x_iy_j P(x_i,y_j) = \\sum_i x_i P(x_i) \\sum_j y_j P(y_j) = E_X E_Y\\] The calculation for two continuous random variables is analogous, only with integrals instead of sums.\nThis demonstrates that the covariance of two independent random variables is 0, and thus that the variance of a sum of two independent random variables is the sum of the two separate variables.\nExample: This property of variance is often used in analysis of noise or error in data.

    "section": "",
    "text": "5.1 Test results vs. the truth\nA large number of scientific questions can be expressed as an hypothesis test—essentially a yes/no question, such as “are two samples drawn from distributions with the same mean?”, or “Is the frequency of an allele in a population greater than 0.1?”. Several tests have been developed, each with a specific type of question in mind. There is a dangerous tendency to view statistics as a collection of tests, and to practice it by plugging in your data set into the correct test, expecting that the test will spit out the correct decision. The purpose of this lesson is to demonstrate that using and interpreting statistical tests requires careful thinking to avoid serious errors.\nA statistical test begins by stating the null hypothesis, usually one that is expected, or that shows no effect: for example, that two samples come from a distribution with the same mean, or that a rare allele has frequency of less than 0.1. One may state the alternative hypothesis explicitly, although it’s usually the logical converse of the null, i.e., the two samples have different population means, or the allele has frequency greater than 0.1.\nAfter the hypothesis is stated, the data are collected and are used to test the hypothesis. By default, the null hypothesis is assumed to be true, and the test assesses whether the data provide sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis—in which case the null hypothesis is rejected. There is an adversarial relationship: either the data knock off the hypothesis, or else they fail to do so. Standard terminology reflects this somewhat counter-intuitive setup: rejecting the null hypothesis is called a positive test result, while not rejecting it is called a negative result.\nThe fundamental assumption of this process is that the truth value of the hypothesis is set prior to the collection of data. For example, if one could observe all of the genomes, the frequency of the allele would be known exactly, so this truth exists prior to the hypothesis testing. Because we typically can only observe a sample (and not the entire universe of data), we might end up erroneously rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true, or not rejecting it when it is in fact false. The possible outcomes of a test can be organized in the table:\nThe values at the top describe the truth status of the hypothesis, while the decisions in the left column are the result of using data to test the hypothesis. Note: the words false and true in describing the test result do not refer to the hypothesis, but to whether the result is correct! For example, if the frequency of the allele were 0.09 but the test for the hypothesis that the frequency is less than 0.1 resulted in rejecting that hypothesis, that would be a false positive result (the null hypothesis is true but the test rejected it.)",

The Type I error rate is the probability of obtaining the positive result, given a true hypothesis (complementary to specificity), and the Type II error rate is the probability of obtaining the negative result, given a false hypothesis (complementary to sensitivity).\nAll four parameters (rates) of a binary test are summarized as follows: \\[\\text{Sen} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN};  \\; \\text{Spec} = \\frac{TN}{TN+FP}\\] \\[\\text{FPR} = \\frac{FP}{TN+FP};  \\; \\text{FNR} = \\frac{FN}{TP+FN}\\] The notation TP, FP, etc. represents the frequency or count of true positives, false positives, etc., out of a large number of experiments with known truth status of the hypothesis.\nKnowledge of sensitivity and specificity determine the Type I and Type II error rates of a test since they are complementary events.\nOf course, it is desirable for a test to be both very sensitive (reject false null hypotheses, detect disease, convict guilty defendants) and very specific (not reject true null hypotheses, correctly identify healthy patients, acquit innocent defendants), but no test is perfect, and sometimes it makes the wrong decision. This is where statistical inference comes into play: given some information about these parameters, a statistician can calculate the error rate in making different decisions.\nThe probability that a given data set is produced from the model of the null hypothesis is called the p-value of a test. More precisely:\n\nFor a given data set \\(D\\) and a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), the p-value is the probability of obtaining a result as far from expectation or farther than the observed data, given the null hypothesis.\n\nThe p-value is the most used, misused, and even abused quantity in statistics, so please think carefully about its definition. One reason this notion is frequently misused is because it is very tempting to conclude that the p-value is the probability of the null hypothesis being true, based on the data. That is not the case! The definition has the opposite direction of conditionality—we assume that the null hypothesis is true, and based on that calculate the probability of obtaining a pattern as extreme or more extreme than what observed in the data. There is no way (according to classical “frequentist” statistics) of assigning a probability to the truth of a hypothesis, because it is not the result of an experiment.\nTypically, one sets a critical threshold bounding the probability of making a Type I error in a test to a “small” number (often, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) or \\(0.01\\)), and calls the result of a test “significant” if the p-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider samples of size \\(n\\) taken from two normal distributions (with unobserved means \\(\\mu_1\\), \\(\\mu_2\\)).

Clearly, this correction becomes overly conservative when the number of tests is large. For example, in biology:\n\nGene expression In a typical microarray experiment, we contrast the differential expression of tens of thousands of genes in treatment and control tissues.\nGWAS In Genomewide Association Studies we want to find SNPs associated with a given phenotype. It is common to test tens of thousands or even millions of SNPs for significant associations.\nIdentifying binding sites Identifying candidate binding sites for a transcriptional regulator requires scanning the whole genome, yielding tens of millions of tests.\n\nThe funniest example of this problem is the fMRI of the dead salmon: a dead salmon “was shown a series of photographs depicting human individuals in social situations with a specified emotional valence. The salmon was asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been experiencing.” The researchers showed that if multiple comparisons were not accounted for, one would detect a cluster of active voxels in the brain, with a cluster-level significance of p = 0.001.\nThe widespread use of GWAS and other techniques that are trying to find a needle in a haystack led to the development of many interesting techniques.

In science, we prefer publishing positive results—negative results are difficult to publish and attract little attention. Suppose that 20 research groups around the world set out to test the same hypothesis, which is false. Then there is a good chance at least one group will reject the null hypothesis, and pursue publication for their “discovery”. The tendency to put negative studies in the files drawer and forget about them causes the so called publication bias (aka selective reporting): by favoring positive results over negative ones, we greatly increase the chance that our conclusions are wrong. Note that these would cause the results of the paper to be largely impossible to reproduce, and the reproducibility crisis in the sciences is partially due to selective reporting.\n\n\n5.6.2 P-hacking\nOne big violation of good experimental design is known as p-value “fishing” (or p-hacking): repeating the experiment, or increasing the sample size, until the p-value is below the desired threshold, and then stopping the experiment. Using such defective design dramatically lowers the likelihood that the result is a true positive. And of course there is actual fraud, or fudging of data, which contributes to some bogus results.\nAn insidious cousin of p-hacking was dubbed by Andrew Gelman “the garden of forking paths” in this paper. The issue arises in complex problems with multi-variable noisy datasets (aren’t all interesting ones like that?) Essentially, with many choices and degrees of freedom in a problem, it is easy to convince yourself that the choice you made (data cleaning, parameter combinations, etc.) is the correct one because it gives the strongest results. Without a clearly stated hypothesis, experimental design, and data processing details prior to data collection, this enchanted garden can lead even a well-intentioned researcher astray.",

    "text": "6.1.1 likelihood vs. probability\nIn everyday English, probability and likelihood are synonymous. In probability and statistics, however, the two are distinct, although related, concepts. The definition of likelihood is based on the notion of conditional probability that we defined in week 2, applied to a data set and a particular probability model \\(M\\):\n\\[\nL(M \\ \\ \\vert \\ \\ D) = P(D \\ \\ \\vert \\ \\ M)\n\\]\nThe model is based on a set of assumptions that allow us to calculate probabilities of outcomes of a random experiment, typically a random variable with a well-defined probability distribution function.\nExample. \\(M\\) may represent the binomial random variable, based on the assumptions that the data are strings of \\(n\\) independent binary outcomes with a set probability \\(p\\) of “success.” We then have the following formula for the probability of obtaining \\(k\\) successes:\n\\[\nP(k ; n , p) =  {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\]\nSuppose we think we have a fair coin and we flip it ten times and obtain 4 heads and 6 tails. Then the likelihood of our model (a binomial random variable with \\(p=0.5\\) with \\(n=10\\)) based on our data (\\(k=4\\)) is:\n\\[\nL(p=0.5, n=10 \\ \\vert \\ k=4 ) = P(k =4 \\ \\vert \\ n=10 , p=0.5) = {10 \\choose 4} 0.5^4 (0.5)^{6}\n\\]\nTo calculate this precisely, it is easiest to use the R function dbinom():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSo the likelihood of this data set being produced by a fair coin is about 20.5%.\nThis certainly looks like a probability — in fact we calculated it from a probability distribution function, so why do we call it a likelihood? There are two fundamental differences between the two, one mostly abstract, the other more grounded.\nFirst, a model (or model parameters) is not a random variable, because it comes from an assumption we made in our heads, not from an outcome of a random process. This may seem to be an abstract, almost philosophical distinction, but how would you go about assigning probabilities to all the models one can come up with? Would they vary from person to person, because one may prefer to use the binomial random variable, and another prefers Poisson? You see how this can get dicey if we think of these in terms of the traditional “frequency of outcomes” framework of probability.\nSecond, and more quantitatively relevant, is that likelihoods do not satisfy the fundamental axiom of probability: they do not add up to one. Remember that probabilities were defined on a sample space of all outcomes of a random experiment. Likelihoods apply to models or their parameters, and there are usually uncountably many models - in fact it’s not possible to even describe all the possible models in vague terms! Even if we agree that we’re evaluating only one type of model, e.g. the binomial random variable, the likelihood parameter \\(p\\) does not work like a probability, because there is a non-zero likelihood for any value \\(p\\) (technically, the coin could have any degree of unfairness!) so adding up all of the likelihoods will results in infinity.\n\n\n6.1.2 maximizing likelihood\nOne of the most common applications of likelihood is to find the model or model parameters that give the highest likelihood based on the data, and call those the best statistical estimate. Here are the symbols we will use in this discussion:\n\n\\(D\\): the observed data\n\\(\\theta\\): the free parameter(s) of the statistical model\n\\(L(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ D)\\): the likelihood function, read “the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) given the data”\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\): the maximum-likelihood estimates (m.l.e.) of the parameters\n\n\n\n6.1.3 discrete probability distributions\nThe simplest case is that of a probability distribution function that takes discrete values. Then, the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) given the data is simply the probability of obtaining the data when parametrizing the model with parameters \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[L(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ D) = P(X = D \\ \\vert \\ \\theta)\\]\nFinding the m.l.e. of \\(\\theta\\) simply means finding the value(s) maximizing the probability of obtaining the given data under the model. In cases when this likelihood function has a simple algebraic form, we can find the maximum value using the classic method of taking its derivative and setting it to zero.\nExample. Let’s go back to the binomial example. Based on the data set of 4 heads out of 10 coin tosses, what is the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability of a head \\(p\\)? The range of values of \\(p\\) is between 0 and 1, and since we have a functional expression for \\(P(k=4 ; n=10, p)\\) (see above) we can plot it using the dbinom() function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s probably not surprising that the maximum of the likelihood function occurs at \\(p=0.4\\), that is the observed fraction of heads! Using the magic of derivatives, we can show that for a data set with \\(k\\) success out of \\(n\\) trials, the maximum likelihood value of \\(p\\) is \\(\\hat p = k/n\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nL(p  \\ \\vert \\ n, k) &= {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\\\ \\hline\nL'(p | n, k ) &= {n \\choose k}\\left [ kp^{k-1}(1-p)^{n-k} - (n-k) (1-p)^{n-k-1}p^k \\right] \\\\\n&={n \\choose k} p^{k-1} (1-p)^{n-k-1} \\left [ k(1-p) - (n-k)p \\right] = 0 \\\\\n\\hline\nk(1-p) &= (n-k)p \\\\\n\\hat p &= k/n\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n6.1.4 continuous probability distributions\nThe definition is more complex for continuous variables (because \\(P(X = x; \\theta) = 0\\) as there are infinitely many values…). What is commonly done is to use the density function \\(f(x; \\theta)\\) and considering the probability of obtaining a value \\(x \\in [x_j, x_j + h]\\), where \\(x_j\\) is our observed data point, and \\(h\\) is small. Then:\n\\[\nL(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ x_j) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{x_j}^{x_j + h} f(x ; \\theta) dx = f(x_j ; \\theta)\n\\]\nNote that, contrary to probabilities, density values can take values greater than 1. As such, when the dispersion is small, one could end up with values of likelihood greater than 1 (or positive log-likelihoods). In fact, the likelihood function is proportional to but not necessarily equal to the probability of generating the data given the parameters: \\(L(\\theta\\vert X) \\propto P(X; \\theta)\\).\nMost classical statistical estimations are based on maximizing a likelihood function. For example, linear regression estimates of slope and intercept are based on minimizing the sum of squares, or more generally, the \\(\\chi\\)-squared statistic. This amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the underlying model, which is based on the assumptions of normally distributed independent residuals.",

    "section": "6.2 Bayesian thinking",
    "text": "6.2 Bayesian thinking\nWe will formalize the process of incorporation of prior knowledge into probabilistic inference by going back to the notion of conditional probability introduced in week 2. First, if you multiply both sides of the definition by \\(P(B)\\), then we obtain the probability of the intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\ \\vert \\ B) P(B); \\;  P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\ \\vert \\ A) P(A) \\]\nSecond, we can partition a sample space into two complementary sets, \\(A\\) and \\(\\bar A\\), and then the set of \\(B\\) can be partitioned into two parts, that intersect with \\(A\\) and \\(\\bar A\\), respectively, so that the probability of \\(B\\) is\n\\[P(B) = P(A \\cap B) + P( \\bar A\\cap B)\\]\nThe two formulas together lead to a very important result called the law of total probability:\n\\[\nP(B) =  P(B \\ \\vert \\ A) P(A) + P(B \\ \\vert \\ \\bar A)P(\\bar A)\n\\]\nIt may not be clear at first glance why this is useful: after all, we replaced something simple (\\(P(B)\\)) with something much more complex on the right hand side. You will see how this formula enables us to calculate quantities that are not otherwise accessible.\nExample: Suppose we know that the probability of a patient having a disease is 1% (called the prevalence of the disease in a population), and the sensitivity and specificity of the test are both 80%. What is the probability of obtaining a negative test result for a randomly selected patient? Let us call \\(P(H) = 0.99\\) the probability of a healthy patient and \\(P(D) = 0.01\\) the probability of a diseased patient. Then: \\[ P(Neg) =  P(Neg  \\ \\vert \\  H) P(H) + P(Neg  \\ \\vert \\  D)P(D)  = \\] \\[ = 0.8 \\times 0.99 + 0.2 \\times 0.01 = 0.794\\]\n\n6.2.1 Bayes’ formula\nTake the first formula in this section, which expresses the probability \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) in two different ways. Since the expressions are equal, we can combine them into one equation, and by dividing both sides by \\(P(B)\\), we obtain what’s known as Bayes’ formula: \\[ P(A \\ \\vert \\ B) = \\frac{P(B \\ \\vert \\ A) P(A)}{P(B) }\\]\nAnother version of Bayes’ formula re-writes the denominator using the Law of total probability above: \\[\nP(A \\ \\vert \\ B) = \\frac{P(B \\ \\vert \\ A)P(A)}{P(B \\ \\vert \\ A) P(A) + P(B \\ \\vert \\ \\bar A)P( \\bar A)}\n\\]\nBayes’ formula gives us the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) from probabilities of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) and given \\(-A\\), and the prior (baseline) probability of \\(P(A)\\). This is enormously useful when it is easy to calculate the conditionals one way and not the other. Among its many applications, it computes the effect of a test result with given sensitivity and specificity (conditional probabilities) on the probability of the hypothesis being true.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 positive predictive value\nIn reality, a doctor doesn’t have the true information about the patient’s health, but rather the information from the test and hopefully some information about the population where she is working. Let us assume we know the rate of false positives \\(P(Pos \\ \\vert \\ H\\)) and the rate of false negatives \\(P(Neg \\ \\vert \\  D)\\), as well as the prevalence of the disease in the whole population \\(P(D)\\). Then we can use Bayes’ formula to answer the practical question, if the test result is positive, what is the probability the patient is actually sick? This is called the positive predictive value of a test. The deep Bayesian fact is that one cannot make inferences about the health of the patient after the test without some prior knowledge, specifically the prevalence of the disease in the population:\n\\[ P(D  \\ \\vert \\  Pos) =  \\frac{P(Pos \\ \\vert \\ D)P(D)}{P(Pos \\ \\vert \\ D) P(D) + P(Pos  \\ \\vert \\  H)P(H)}\\]\nExample. Suppose the test has a 0.01 probability of both false positive and false negatives, and the overall prevalence of the disease in the population 0.02. You may be surprised that from an epidemiological perspective, a positive result is far from definitive:\n\\[ P(D  \\ \\vert \\  Pos)  = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.02}{0.99 \\times 0.02 + 0.01 \\times 0.98} = 0.67 \\]\nThis is because the disease is so rare, that even though the test is quite accurate, there are going to be a lot of false positives (about 1/3 of the time) since 98% of the patients are healthy.\nWe can also calculate the probability of a patient who tests negative of actually being healthy, which is called the negative predictive value. In this example, it is far more definitive:\n\\[ P(H  \\ \\vert \\  Neg)  = \\frac{P(Neg \\ \\vert \\ H)P(H)}{P(Neg \\ \\vert \\ H) P(H) + P(Neg  \\ \\vert \\  D)P(D)} = \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.98}{0.99 \\times 0.98 + 0.01 \\times 0.02} =  0.9998\\] This is again because this disease is quite rare in this population, so a negative test result is almost guaranteed to be correct. In another population, where disease is more prevalent, this may not be the case.\n\n\n\nBayesian hypothesis testing tree with prior probability 0.1\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian hypothesis testing tree with prior probability 0.01\n\n\nExercise: Simulate medical testing by rolling dice for a rare disease (1/6 prevalence) and a common disease (1/2 prevalence), with both sensitivity and specificity of 5/6. Compare the positive predictive values for the two cases.\n\n\n6.2.3 prosecutor’s fallacy\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThe basic principle of Bayesian thinking is that one cannot interpret the reliability of a result, e.g. a hypothesis test, without factoring in the prior probability of it being true. This seems like a commonsensical concept, but it is often neglected when such results are interpreted in various contexts, which can lead to perilous mistakes.\nHere is a scenario called “the prosecutor’s fallacy”. Suppose that a defendant is accused of a crime, and physical evidence collected at the crime scene matches this person (e.g. a fingerprint or a DNA sample), but no other evidence exists to connect the defendant to the crime. The prosecutor calls an expert witness to testify that fewer than one out of a million randomly chosen people would match this sample. Therefore, she argues, there is overwhelming probability that the defendant is guilty and less than 1 in a million chance they are innocent.\nDo you spot the problem with the argument?\nIt’s the same fallacy as we saw in the medical testing scenario, or that is portrayed in the xkcd cartoon above. The prosecutor is conflating the probability of a match (positive result) given that the person is innocent, and the probability of the person being innocent, given the match. The probability of the former is one in a million, but we want to know the latter! And the latter depends on the prior probability of the person committing the crime, which should have been investigated by the detectives: did the defendant have a conflict with the victim or have they never met? did he have opportunity to commit the crime, or was he in a different city at the time? Without this information, it is impossible to decide whether it’s more likely that the DNA/fingerprint match is a false positive (in a country of 300 million, you can find 300 false matches if everyone is in the database!) or a true positive.\n\n\n6.2.4 reproducibility in science\nIn 2005 John Ioannidis published a paper entitled “Why most published research findings are false”. The paper, as you can see by its title, was intended to be provocative, but it is based solidly on the classic formula of Bayes. The motivation for the paper came from the observation that too often in modern science, big, splashy studies that were published could not be reproduced or verified by other researchers. What could be behind this epidemic of questionable scientific work?\nThe problem as described by Ioannidis and many others, in a nutshell, is that unthinking use of traditional hypothesis testing leads to a high probability of false positive results being published. The paper outlines several ways in which this can occur.\nToo often, a hypothesis is tested and if the resultant p-value is less than some arbitrary threshold (very often 0.05, an absurdly high number), then the results are published. However, if one is testing a hypothesis with low prior probability, a positive hypothesis test result is very likely a false positive. Very often, modern biomedical research involves digging through a large amount of information, like an entire human genome, in search for associations between different genes and a phenotype, like a disease. It is a priori unlikely that any specific gene is linked to a given phenotype, because most genes have very specific functions, and are expressed quite selectively, only at specific times or in specific types of cells. However, publishing such studies results in splashy headlines (“Scientists find a gene linked to autism!”) and so a lot of false positive results are reported, only to be refuted later, in much less publicized studies.\nIoannidis performed basic calculations of the probability that a published study is true (that is, that a positive reported result is a true positive), and how it is affected by pre-study (prior) probability, number of conducted studies on the same hypothesis, and the level of bias. His prediction is that for fairly typical scenario (e.g. pre-study probability of 10%, ten groups working simultaneously, and a reasonable amount of bias) the probability that a published result is correct is less than 50%. He then followed up with another paper [2] that investigated 49 top-cited medical research publications over a decade, and looked at whether follow-up studies could replicate the results, and found that a very significant fraction of their findings could not be replicated or were found to have weaker effects by subsequent investigations.",

    "text": "6.3 Bayesian inference\nAs an alternative to frequentist and maximum likelihood approaches to modeling biological data, Bayesian statistics has seen an impressive growth in recent years, due to the improved computational power.\nAt the heart of Bayesian inference is an application of Bayes’ theorem: take a model with parameters \\(\\theta\\), and some data \\(D\\). Bayes’ theorem gives us a disciplined way to “update” our belief in the distribution of \\(\\theta\\) once we’ve seen the data \\(D\\):\n\\[\nP(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ D) = \\frac{P(D \\ \\vert \\ \\theta) P(\\theta)}{P(D)}\n\\] where:\n\n\\(P(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ D)\\) is the posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\), i.e., our updated belief in the values of \\(\\theta\\).\n\\(P(D \\ \\vert \\ \\theta)\\) is the likelihood function: \\(P(DX \\ \\vert \\ \\theta) = L(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ D)\\).\n\\(P(\\theta)\\) is the prior distribution, i.e. our belief on the distribution of \\(\\theta\\) before seeing the data.\n\\(P(D)\\) is called the evidence: \\(P(D) = \\int P(D \\ \\vert \\ \\theta) d \\theta\\) (in practice, this need not to be calculated).\n\n\n6.3.1 Example: capture-recapture\nThere is a well-established method in population ecology of estimating the size of a population by repeatedly capturing and tagging a number of individuals and later repeating the experiment to see how many are recaptured. Suppose that \\(n\\) were captured initially and \\(k\\) were recaptured later. We assume that the probability \\(p\\) of recapturing an individual is the same for all individuals. Then our likelihood function is once again, based on the binomial distribution.\n\\[\nL(p \\ \\vert \\ k, n) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n\\] and our maximum likelihood estimate is \\(\\hat{p} = k /n\\). This allows for estimation of the total population size to be \\(P = n_2/\\hat p\\), where \\(n_2\\) is the total number of individuals captured in the second experiment. There are more sophisticated estimators, but this one is reasonable for large enough populations.\nLet us plot the likelihood as a function of \\(p\\) for the case in which \\(n = 100\\) and \\(k = 33\\)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow we choose a prior. For convenience, we choose a Beta distribution, \\(P(p) = \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{p^{\\alpha - 1} (1-p)^{\\beta - 1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}\\), where \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is the Beta function, \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^1 t^{\\alpha -1} (1-t)^{\\beta - 1} dt\\).\nTherefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(p \\ \\ \\vert \\ \\ m,n) & \\propto L(p \\ \\ \\vert \\ \\ m,n) P(p) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\binom{n}{m} p^m (1-p)^{n-m} \\right) \\left( \\frac{p^{\\alpha - 1} (1-p)^{\\beta - 1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} \\right)\\\\\n& \\propto p^{m+\\alpha -1} (1-p)^{n-m + \\beta -1} \\\\\n& \\propto \\text{Beta}(m + \\alpha, \\beta + m - n)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can explore the effect of choosing a prior on the posterior. Suppose that in the past we have seen probabilities close to 50%. Then we could choose a prior \\(\\text{Beta}(10,10)\\) (this is what is called a “strong” or “informative” prior). Let’s see what happens to the posterior:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can see that the posterior “mediates” between the prior and the likelihood curve. When we use a weak prior, then our posterior will be closer to the likelihood function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe fact that the posterior depends on the prior is the most controversial aspect of Bayesian inference. Different schools of thought treat this feature differently (e.g., “Subjective Bayes” interprets priors as beliefs before seeing the data; “Empirical Bayes” relies on previous experiments or on the data themselves to derive the prior; “Objective Bayes” tries to derive the least-informative prior given the data). In practice, the larger the data, the cleaner the signal, the lesser the influence of the prior on the resulting posterior.\n\n\n6.3.2 MCMC\nThe type of calculation performed above is feasible only for very simple models, and for appropriately chosen priors (called “conjugate priors”). For more complex models, we rely on simulations. In particular, one can use Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior distribution of complex models. Very briefly, one builds a Markov-Chain in which the states represent sets of parameters; parameters are sampled from the prior, and the probability of moving to one state to another is proportional to the difference in their likelihood. When the MC converges, then one obtains the posterior distribution of the parameters.\nBayesian inference is used for many complex problems, including phylogenetic tree building [5].",

    "text": "7.1 Solving multivariate linear equations\nGoals\nLinear algebra is intimately tied to linear equations, that is, to equations where all variables are multiplied by constant terms and added together. Linear equations with one variable are easily solved by division, for example:\n\\[\n4x = 20\n\\]\nis solved by dividing both sides by 4, obtaining the unique solution \\(x=5\\).\nThe situation gets more interesting when multiple variables are involved, with multiple equations, for example:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n4x - 3y &= 5 \\\\\n-x + 2y &= 10\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThere are multiple ways to solve this, for example solving one equation for one variable in terms of the other, then substituting it into the second equation to obtain a one-variable problem. A more general approach involves writing this problem in terms of a matrix \\(\\mathbf A\\) that contains the multiplicative constants of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and a vector \\(\\vec b\\) that contains the right-hand side constants:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -3 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\;\\;\\; \\vec{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}5 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix} &\\;\\;\\;\n\\vec{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\mathbf{A} \\vec x = \\vec b &\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis now looks analogous to the one-variable equation above, which we solved by dividing both sides by the multiple of \\(x\\). The difficulty is that matrix operations are more complicated than scalar multiplication and division. Matrix multiplication is used in the equation above to multiply all the coefficients in the matrix by their respective variables, which involves a relatively complicated procedure in general.\nThe “division” equivalent is called matrix inversion and it is even more complicated. First, we need to define the identity matrix, or the equivalent of the number 1 for matrix multiplication. The identity matrix is defined only for square matrices (equal number of rows and columns), so a size \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) identity matrix is define to have all 1s on the diagonal and all zeros on the off-diagonal: \\[\nI = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1  &\\dots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 &\\dots & 1\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] The identity matrix is special because multiplying any other matrix (of compatible size) by it results in the same exact matrix (this is easy to check on a couple of examples for \\(2 \\times 2\\) or \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrices):\n\\[\nI A = A I = A\n\\] Then for an \\(n\\) by \\(n\\) matrix \\(A\\) its inverse \\(A^{-1}\\) is defined to be the matrix multiplication by which results in the identity matrix, that is: \\[\nA^{-1} A = A A^{-1}  = I\n\\] Defining the inverse is one task, but calculating it for any given matrix, especially of large size, is quite laborious. We will not describe the algorithms here, but you can read about Gauss-Jordan elimination, which is one classic example. One important point is that not all matrices are invertible, and for some no inverse matrix exists, analogous to zero for real number division. The difference is that there are infinitely many matrices for which this is the case, called singular matrices.\nIn the cases in which the inverse matrix exists, the linear system of equations can be solved by multiplying both sides by the inverse matrix, like this: \\[\n\\vec x = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\vec b\n\\]\nExample: Take the linear \\(2 \\times 2\\) system of equations of above and solve it using matrix inversion.The R function solve() calculates the inverse and multiplies it by the constant vector b:",

    "text": "7.2 Fitting a line to data\nOne geometric application of solving multiple linear equations is to find the coefficients of a line that passes through two points in the 2-dimensional plane (or of a plane that passes through three points in three-dimensional space, but we won’t go there.) In that case, the coordinates of the points are the data, and the unknown variables are the parameters slope \\(m\\) and intercept \\(b\\) of the line that we want to find.\nExample: If the data set consists of two points \\((3,5), (6, 2)\\), then finding the best fit values of \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) means solving the following two equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n3m + b &= 5 \\\\\n6m + b &= 2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThese equations have a solution for the slope and intercept, which can be calculated in R using solve() and then plot the line with the parameters from the solution vector beta:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHowever, a data set with two points is very small and nobody would accept these values as reasonable estimates. Let us add one more data point, to increase our sample size to three: \\((3,5), (6, 2), (9, 1)\\). How do you find the best fit slope and intercept?\nBad idea: take two points and find a line, that is the slope and the intercept, that passes through the two. It should be clear why this is a bad idea: we are arbitrarily ignoring some of the data, while perfectly fitting two points. So how do we use all the data? Let us write down the equations that a line with slope \\(m\\) and intercept \\(b\\) have to satisfy in order to fit our data points:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n3m + b = 5 \\\\\n6m + b = 2\\\\\n9m + b = 1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis system has no exact solution, since there are three equations and only two unknowns. We need to find \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) such that they are a “best fit” to the data, not the perfect solution.\n\n7.2.1 Least-squares line\nLet us write the equation in matrix form as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 6 & 1 \\\\ 9 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\;\\;\\; \\vec{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\;\\;\\;\n\\vec{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} m \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\mathbf{A} \\vec \\beta = \\vec b\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nMathematically, the problem is that one cannot invert a non-square matrix. However, there is a way of turning the matrix into a square one, by multiplying it by its own transpose (same matrix with rows and columns reversed):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A} \\vec \\beta = \\mathbf{A}^T \\vec b\n\\] Exercise: Carry out the matrix multiplications to verify that \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A}\\) is a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix and \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\vec b\\) is a vector of length 2.\nNow we can solve this equation with a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A}\\) by multiplying both sides by the inverse!

    "section": "7.3 Linearity and vector spaces",
    "text": "7.3 Linearity and vector spaces\nWe have dealt with linear models in various guises, so now would be a good time to define properly what linearity means. The word comes from the shape of graphs of linear functions of one variable, e.g. \\(f(x) = a x + b\\), but the algebraic meaning rests on the following two general properties:\nDefinition. A linear transformation or linear operator is a mapping \\(L\\) between two sets of vectors with the following properties:\n\n(scalar multiplication) \\(L(c \\vec v) = c L(\\vec v)\\); where \\(c\\) is a scalar and \\(\\vec v\\) is a vector\n(additive) \\(L(\\vec v_1 + \\vec v_2) = L(\\vec v_1) + L(\\vec v_2)\\); where \\(\\vec v_1\\) and \\(\\vec v_2\\) are vectors\n\nHere we have two types of objects: vectors and transformations/operators that act on those vectors. The basic example of this are vectors and matrices, because a matrix multiplied by a column vector (on the right) results in another column vector, provided the number of columns in the matrix is the same as the number of rows in the vector. This can be interpreted as the matrix transforming the vector \\(\\vec v\\) into another one: \\(A \\times \\vec v = \\vec u\\).\nExample: Let us multiply the following matrix and vector (specially chosen to make a point):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe see that this particular vector \\((1,-1)\\) is unchanged when multiplied by this matrix, or we can say that the matrix multiplication is equivalent to multiplication by 1. Here is another such vector for the same matrix:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this case, the vector is changed, but only by multiplication by a constant (4). Thus the geometric direction of the vector remained unchanged.\nThe notion of linearity leads to the important idea of combining different vectors:\nDefinition: A linear combination of \\(n\\) vectors \\(\\{ \\vec v_i \\}\\) is a weighted sum of these vectors with any real numbers \\(\\{a_i\\}\\): \\[ a_1 \\vec v_1+ a_2 \\vec v_2... + a_n \\vec v_n\\]\nLinear combinations arise naturally from the notion of linearity, combining the additive property and the scalar multiplication property. Speaking intuitively, a linear combination of vectors produces a new vector that is related to the original set. Linear combinations give a simple way of generating new vectors, and thus invite the following definition for a collection of vectors closed under linear combinations:\nDefinition. A vector space is a collection of vectors such that a linear combination of any \\(n\\) vectors is contained in the vector space.\nThe most common examples are the spaces of all real-valued vectors of dimension \\(n\\), which are denoted by \\(\\mathbb{webr-r}^n\\). For instance, \\(\\mathbb{webr-r}^2\\) (pronounced “r two”) is the vector space of two dimensional real-valued vectors such as \\((1,3)\\) and \\((\\pi, -\\sqrt{17})\\); similarly, \\(\\mathbb{webr-r}^3\\) is the vector space consisting of three dimensional real-valued vectors such as \\((0.1,0,-5.6)\\). You can convince yourself, by taking linear combinations of vectors, that these vector spaces contain all the points in the usual Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space. The real number line can also be thought of as the vector space \\(\\mathbb{webr-r}^1\\).\n\n7.3.1 Linear independence and basis vectors\nHow can we describe a vector space without trying to list all of its elements? We know that one can generate an element by taking linear combinations of vectors. It turns out that it is possible to generate (or “span”) a vector space by taking linear combinations of a subset of its vectors. The challenge is to find a minimal subset of subset that is not redundant. In order to do this, we first introduce a new concept:\nDefinition: A set of vectors \\(\\{ \\vec v_i \\}\\) is called linearly independent if the only linear combination involving them that equals the zero vector is if all the coefficients are zero. ( \\(a_1 \\vec v_1 + a_2 \\vec v_2 + ... + a_n \\vec v_n = 0\\) only if \\(a_i = 0\\) for all \\(i\\).)\nIn the familiar Euclidean spaces, e.g. \\(\\mathbb{webr-r}^2\\), linear independence has a geometric meaning: two vectors are linearly independent if the segments from the origin to the endpoint do not lie on the same line. But it can be shown that any set of three vectors in the plane is linearly dependent, because there are only two dimensions in the vector space. This brings us to the key definition of this section:\nDefinition: A basis of a vector space is a linearly independent set of vectors that generate (or span) the vector space. The number of vectors (cardinality) in such a set is called the dimension of the vector space.\nA vector space generally has many possible bases, as illustrated in figure. In the case of \\(\\mathbb{webr-r}^2\\), the usual (canonical) basis set is \\(\\{(1,0); (0,1)\\}\\) which obviously generates any point on the plane and is linearly independent. But any two linearly independent vectors can generate any vector in the plane.\nExample: The vector \\(\\vec r = (2,1)\\) can be represented as a linear combination of the two canonical vectors: \\(\\vec r = 2\\times (1,0)+1\\times (0,1)\\). Let us choose another basis set, say \\(\\{(1,1); (-1,1)\\}\\) (this is the canonical basis vectors rotated by \\(\\pi/2\\).) The same vector can be represented by a linear combination of these two vectors, with coefficients \\(1.5\\) and \\(-0.5\\): \\(\\vec r = 1.5\\times (1,1) - 0.5 \\times (-1,1)\\). If we call the first basis \\(C\\) for canonical and the second basis \\(D\\) for different, we can write the same vector using different sets of coordinates for each basis:\n\\[\n\\vec r_{C} = (2,1); \\; \\vec r_D = (1.5, -0.5)\n\\]\n\n\n7.3.2 Projections and changes of basis\nThe representation of an arbitrary vector (point) in a vector space as a linear combination of a given basis set is called the decomposition of the point in terms of the basis, which gives the coordinates for the vector in terms of each basis vector. The decomposition of a point in terms of a particular basis is very useful in high-dimensional spaces, where a clever choice of a basis can allow a description of a set of points (such as a data set) in terms of contributions of only a few basis vectors, if the data set primarily extends only in a few dimensions.\nTo obtain the coefficients of the basis vectors in a decomposition of a vector \\(\\vec r\\), we need to perform what is termed a projection of the vector onto the basis vectors. Think of shining a light perpendicular to the basis vector, and measuring the length of the shadow cast by the vector \\(\\vec r\\) onto \\(\\vec v_i\\). If the vectors are parallel, the shadow is equal to the length of \\(\\vec r\\); if they are orthogonal, the shadow is nonexistent. To find the length of the shadow, use the inner product of \\(\\vec r\\) and \\(\\vec v\\), which as you recall corresponds to the cosine of the angle between the two vectors multiplied by their norms: \\(\\left\\langle \\vec r, \\vec v\\right \\rangle =\\vert\\vec r\\vert \\vert\\vec v\\vert\\cos(\\theta)\\). We do not care about the length of the vector \\(\\vec v\\) we are projecting onto, thus we divide the inner product by the square norm of \\(\\vec v\\), and then multiply the vector \\(\\vec v\\) by this projection coefficient:\n\\[\nProj(\\vec r ; \\vec v) = \\frac{ \\langle \\vec r , \\vec v \\rangle  } {\\langle \\vec v , \\vec v \\rangle } \\vec v = \\frac{ \\langle \\vec r ,  \\vec v \\rangle  } {\\vert \\vec v \\vert^2} \\vec v= \\frac{  \\vert\\vec r\\vert \\cos(\\theta) } {\\vert \\vec v \\vert}\\vec v\n\\]\nThis formula gives the projection of the vector \\(\\vec r\\) onto \\(\\vec v\\), the result is a new vector in the direction of \\(\\vec v\\), with the scalar coefficient \\(a = \\ \\langle \\vec r , \\vec v \\rangle /\\vert \\vec v \\vert^2\\).\nExample: Here is how one might calculate the projection of the point \\((2,1)\\) onto the basis set \\(\\{(1,1); (-1,1)\\}\\):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is not quite right: the projection coefficients are off by a factor of two compared to the correct values in the example above. This is because we have neglected to normalize the basis vectors, so we should modify the script as follows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is an example of how to convert a vector/point from representation in one basis set to another. The new basis vectors, expressed in the original basis set, are arranged in a matrix by row, scaled by their norm squared, and multiplied by the vector that one wants to express in the new basis. The resulting vector contains the coordinates in the new basis.",

    "section": "7.4 Matrices as linear operators",
    "text": "7.4 Matrices as linear operators\n\n7.4.1 Matrices transform vectors\nIn this section we will learn to characterize square matrices by finding special numbers and vectors associated with them. At the core of this analysis lies the concept of a matrix as an operator that transforms vectors by multiplication. To be clear, in this section we take as default that the matrices \\(A\\) are square, and that vectors \\(\\vec v\\) are column vectors, and thus will multiply the matrix on the right: \\(A \\times \\vec v\\).\nA matrix multiplied by a vector produces another vector, provided the number of columns in the matrix is the same as the number of rows in the vector. This can be interpreted as the matrix transforming the vector \\(\\vec v\\) into another one: \\(A \\times \\vec v = \\vec u\\). The resultant vector \\(\\vec u\\) may or may not resemble \\(\\vec v\\), but there are special vectors for which the transformation is very simple.\nExample. Let us multiply the following matrix and vector (specially chosen to make a point):\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\\\ 2& 3\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 -1 \\\\ 2 - 3 \\end{array}\\right) =  \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nWe see that this particular vector is unchanged when multiplied by this matrix, or we can say that the matrix multiplication is equivalent to multiplication by 1. Here is another such vector for the same matrix:\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\\\ 2& 3\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 +2 \\\\ 2 + 6 \\end{array}\\right) =  \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 4 \\\\ 8 \\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nIn this case, the vector is changed, but only by multiplication by a constant (4). Thus the geometric direction of the vector remained unchanged.\nGenerally, a square matrix has an associated set of vectors for which multiplication by the matrix is equivalent to multiplication by a constant. This can be written down as a definition:\nDefinition. An eigenvector of a square matrix \\(A\\) is a vector \\(\\vec v\\) for which matrix multiplication by \\(A\\) is equivalent to multiplication by a constant. This constant \\(\\lambda\\) is called its eigenvalue of \\(A\\) corresponding the the eigenvector \\(\\vec v\\). The relationship is summarized in the following equation:\n\\[\nA  \\times  \\vec v = \\lambda \\vec v\n\\]\nNote that this equation combines a matrix (\\(A\\)), a vector (\\(\\vec v\\)) and a scalar \\(\\lambda\\), and that both sides of the equation are column vectors.\nThe definition does not specify how many such eigenvectors and eigenvalues can exist for a given matrix \\(A\\). There are usually as many such vectors \\(\\vec v\\) and corresponding numbers \\(\\lambda\\) as the number of rows or columns of the square matrix \\(A\\), so a 2 by 2 matrix has two eigenvectors and two eigenvalues, a 5x5 matrix has 5 of each, etc. One ironclad rule is that there cannot be more distinct eigenvalues than the matrix dimension. Some matrices possess fewer eigenvalues than the matrix dimension, those are said to have a degenerate set of eigenvalues, and at least two of the eigenvectors share the same eigenvalue.\nThe situation with eigenvectors is trickier. There are some matrices for which any vector is an eigenvector, and others which have a limited set of eigenvectors. What is difficult about counting eigenvectors is that an eigenvector is still an eigenvector when multiplied by a constant. You can show that for any matrix, multiplication by a constant is commutative: \\(cA = Ac\\), where \\(A\\) is a matrix and \\(c\\) is a constant. This leads us to the important result that if \\(\\vec v\\) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), then any scalar multiple \\(c \\vec v\\) is also an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue. The following demonstrates this algebraically:\n\\[\nA  \\times  (c \\vec v) = c A  \\times  \\vec v = c \\lambda \\vec v =  \\lambda (c \\vec v)\n\\]\nThis shows that when the vector \\(c \\vec v\\) is multiplied by the matrix \\(A\\), it results in its being multiplied by the same number \\(\\lambda\\), so by definition it is an eigenvector. Therefore, an eigenvector \\(\\vec v\\) is not unique, as any constant multiple \\(c \\vec v\\) is also an eigenvector. It is more useful to think not of a single eigenvector \\(\\vec v\\), but of a collection of vectors that can be inter-converted by scalar multiplication that are all essentially the same eigenvector. Another way to represent this, if the eigenvector is real, is that an eigenvector as a direction that remains unchanged by multiplication by the matrix, such as direction of the vector \\(v\\) in the figure below. As mentioned above, this is true only for real eigenvalues and eigenvectors, since complex eigenvectors cannot be used to define a direction in a real space.\n\n\n\nIllustration of the geometry of a matrix \\(A\\) multiplying its eigenvector \\(v\\), resulting in a vector in the same direction \\(\\lambda v\\)\n\n\nTo summarize, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix are a set of numbers and a set of vectors (up to scalar multiple) that describe the action of the matrix as a multiplicative operator on vectors. “Well-behaved” square \\(n \\times n\\) matrices have \\(n\\) distinct eigenvalues and \\(n\\) eigenvectors pointing in distinct directions. In a deep sense, the collection of eigenvectors and eigenvalues defines a matrix \\(A\\), which is why an older name for them is characteristic vectors and values.\n\n\n7.4.2 calculating eigenvalues\nFinding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors analytically, that is on paper, is quite laborious even for 3 by 3 or 4 by 4 matrices and for larger ones there is no analytical solution. In practice, the task is outsourced to a computer, and MATLAB has a number of functions for this purpose. Nevertheless, it is useful to go through the process in 2 dimensions in order to gain an understanding of what is involved. From the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the condition can be written in terms of the four elements of a 2 by 2 matrix:\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}a & b \\\\c & d\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}av_1 +b v_2\\\\ cv_1+ dv_2 \\end{array}\\right) = \\lambda \\left(\\begin{array}{c}v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nThis is now a system of two linear algebraic equations, which we can solve by substitution. First, let us solve for \\(v_1\\) in the first row, to get \\[v_1 = \\frac{-bv_2}{a-\\lambda}\\] Then we substitute this into the second equation and get:\n\\[\n\\frac{-bcv_2}{a-\\lambda} +(d-\\lambda)v_2 = 0\n\\]\nSince \\(v_2\\) multiplies both terms, and is not necessarily zero, we require that its multiplicative factor be zero. Doing a little algebra, we obtain the following, known as the characteristic equation of the matrix:\n\\[\n-bc +(a-\\lambda)(d-\\lambda) = \\lambda^2-(a+d)\\lambda +ad-bc = 0\n\\]\nThis equation can be simplified by using two quantities we defined at the beginning of the section: the sum of the diagonal elements called the trace \\(\\tau = a+d\\), and the determinant \\(\\Delta = ad-bc\\). The quadratic equation has two solutions, dependent solely on \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\Delta\\):\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\tau \\pm \\sqrt{\\tau^2-4\\Delta}}{2}\n\\]\nThis is the general expression for a 2 by 2 matrix, showing there are two possible eigenvalues. Note that if \\(\\tau^2-4\\Delta&gt;0\\), the eigenvalues are real, if \\(\\tau^2-4\\Delta&lt;0\\), they are complex (have real and imaginary parts), and if \\(\\tau^2-4\\Delta=0\\), there is only one eigenvalue. This situation is known as degenerate, because two eigenvectors share the same eigenvalue.\nExample. Let us take the same matrix we looked at in the previous subsection:\n\\[\nA = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}2 & 1 \\\\ 2& 3\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nThe trace of this matrix is \\(\\tau = 2+3 =5\\) and the determinant is \\(\\Delta = 6 - 2 = 4\\). Then by our formula, the eigenvalues are:\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2-4 \\times 4}}{2}  =  \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{2}  = 4, 1\n\\]\nThese are the multiples we found in the example above, as expected. Of course R has functions to calculate this instead of doing this by hand:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote: a real-valued matrix can have complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but whenever it acts on a real vector, the result is still real. This is because the complex numbers cancel each others imaginary parts.",

    "text": "8.2 Finding the best fitting line: Linear Regression\nHow can we explain the relationship between the height of the fathers and those of their sons? One of the simplest models we can use is called a “Linear Model”. Basically, we want to express the height of the son as a function of the height of the father:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) is the height of the son (response variable), \\(x_i\\) is the height of the father (explanatory variable), \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are two numbers (intercept and slope of the line) that do not vary within the population (these are the parameters we want to fit). Finally, the term \\(\\epsilon_i\\) measures the “error” we are making for the \\(i^{th}\\) son. For simplicity, we assume the \\(\\epsilon_i \\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} \\mathcal N(0, \\sigma^2)\\) (and \\(\\sigma\\) is therefore another parameter we want to fit).\nWhen we have multiple explanatory variables (for example, if we had recorded also the height of the mother, whether the son was born at full term or premature, the average caloric intake for the family, etc.), we speak of Multiple Linear Regression:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k x_{ik} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n8.2.1 Solving a linear model — some linear algebra\nIn this section, we’re going to look at the mechanics of linear regression. Suppose that for simplicity we have a single explanatory variable, then we can write the linear model in compact form as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} + \\mathbf{\\epsilon}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1\\\\ y_2\\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix} \\;\\;\\;\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_1\\\\ 1 & x_2\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\;\\;\\;\n\\mathbf{\\beta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1\\end{pmatrix} \\;\\;\\; \\mathbf{\\epsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSolving the linear regression means finding the best-fitting \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) (controlling the spread of the distribution of the \\(\\epsilon_i\\)). Our goal is to find the values of \\(\\beta\\) that minimize \\(\\sigma\\) (meaning that the points fall closer to the line). Rearranging:\n\\[\n\\sum_i \\epsilon_i^2 = \\sum_i (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x_i)^2 =  \\Vert \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\Vert\n\\]\nAs such, we want to find the vector \\(\\beta\\) that minimizes the norm \\(\\Vert \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{\\beta} \\Vert\\).

Here are the main ones:\n\nModel structure: we assume that the process generating the data is linear.\nExplanatory variable: we assume that this is measured without errors (!).\nResiduals: we assume that residuals are i.i.d. Normal.\nStrict exogeneity: the residuals should have conditional mean of 0.\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb E[\\epsilon_i | x_i] = 0\n\\]\n\nNo linear dependence: the columns of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) should be linearly independent.\nHomoscedasticity: the variance of the residuals is independent of \\(x_i\\).\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb V[\\epsilon_i | x_i] =  \\sigma^2\n\\]\n\nErrors are uncorrelated between observations.\n\n\\[\n\\mathbb E[\\epsilon_i \\epsilon_j | x] = 0 \\; \\forall j \\neq i\n\\]",

    "section": "8.5 More advanced topics",
    "text": "8.5 More advanced topics\n\n8.5.1 Categorical variables in linear models\nIn the example above, we have built the model:\n\\[\n\\log(\\text{NCIT} + 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\log(\\text{IF} + 1))_i + \\beta_2 (\\text{SHARE})_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nIn this case, the variable SHARE takes values of 1 or 0. As such, when the data were not shared (SHARE = 0) the model reduces to the previous one, in which \\(\\beta_2\\) was absent. The coefficient \\(\\beta_2\\) measures the increase in the log of citation count when data are shared.\nThe same approach can be taken whenever you have categorical values: R will automatically create dummy variables each encoding whether the ith data point belongs to a particular category. For example, suppose you want to predict the height of a child based on the height of the father, and that you also collected the gender, in three categories: F for female, M for male, U for unknown. Then you could use this information to build the model:\n\\[\n\\text{height}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{(height of father)}_i + \\beta_2 (\\text{gender is M})_i + \\beta_3 (\\text{gender is U})_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhere the variable gender is M takes value 1 when the gender is M and 0 otherwise, and gender is U takes value 1 when the gender is unknown and 0 otherwise. As such, when the gender is F both variables will be zero, and \\(\\beta_2\\) and \\(\\beta_3\\) measure the increase (or decrease) in height for males and those with unspecified gender, respectively. While R does this for you automatically, understanding what is going on “under the hood” is essential for interpreting the results.\n\n\n8.5.2 Interactions in linear models\nSometimes we think that our explanatory variables could “interact”. For example, suppose you want to predict the BMI of people. What we have available is the average caloric intake, the height, gender, and whether they are vegetarian, vegan, or omnivores. A simple model could be:\n\\[\n\\text{BMI}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_h \\text{height}_i + \\beta_c \\text{calories}_i + \\beta_g \\text{gender}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nWe could add the type of diet as a factor:\n\\[\n\\text{BMI}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_h \\text{height}_i + \\beta_c \\text{calories}_i + \\beta_g \\text{gender}_i + \\beta_d \\text{diet}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nHowever, suppose that we believe the type of diet to affect differentially men and women. Then, we would like to create an “interaction” (e.g., paleo-female, vegan-male):\n\\[\n\\text{BMI}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_h \\text{height}_i + \\beta_c \\text{calories}_i + \\beta_g \\text{gender}_i + \\beta_d \\text{diet}_i + \\beta_{gd} \\text{gender:diet}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhere the colon signals “interaction”. In R, this would be coded as lm(BMI ~ height + calories + gender * diet). A simpler model is one in which we only account for the gender:diet interaction, but not for the separate effects of gender and diet:\n\\[\n\\text{BMI}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_h \\text{height}_i + \\beta_c \\text{calories}_i + \\beta_{gd}\\text{gender:diet}_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhich in R can be coded as lm(BMI ~ height + calories + gender:diet). Finally, for some models you believe the intercept should be 0 (note that this makes the \\(R^2\\) statistics uninterpretable!). In R, just put -1 at the end of the definition of the model (e.g., lm(BMI ~ height + calories + gender:diet - 1)).\n\n\n8.5.3 Regression diagnostics\nNow that we know the mechanics of linear regression, we turn to diagnostics: how can we make sure that the model fits the data “well”? We start by analyzing a data set assembled by Anscombe (The American Statistician, 1973)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe file comprised four data sets. We perform a linear regression using each data set separately:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs you can see, each data set is best fit by the same line, with intercept 3 and slope \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Plotting the data, however, shows that the situation is more complicated:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nData_1 is fitted quite well; Data_2 shows a marked nonlinearity; all points but one in Data_3 are on the same line, but a single outlier shifts the line considerably; finally, in Data_4 a single point is responsible for the fitting line: all other values of X are exactly the same. Inspecting the graphs, we would conclude that we can trust our model only in the first case. When you are performing a multiple regression, however, it is hard to see whether we’re in case 1, or one of the other cases. R provides a number of diagnostic tools which can help you decide whether the fit to the data is good.\n\n\n8.5.4 Plotting the residuals\nThe first thing you want to do is to plot the residuals as a function of the fitted values. This plot should make it apparent whether the data was linear or not. The package lindia (linear regression diagnostics) makes it easy to produce this type of plot using ggplot2:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat you are looking for is an approximately flat line, meaning that the residuals are approximately normally distributed with mean zero for each fitted value. This is not the case in the other data sets:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n8.5.5 Q-Q Plot\nWe can take this further, and test whether the residuals follow a normal distribution. In particular, we can estimate the density of the residuals, and plot it against the density of a normal distribution:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, you are looking for a good match to the 1:1 line; outliers will be found far from the line (e.g., case 3).\n\n\n8.5.6 Cook’s distance\nAnother way to detect outliers is to compute the Cook’s distance for every point. Briefly, this statistic measures the effect on the regression we would obtain if we were to remove a point.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n8.5.7 Leverage\nPoints that strongly influence the regression are said to have much “leverage”:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n8.5.8 Running all diagnostics\nThese are but a few of the diagnostics available.

Essentially, this is a generalization of linear regression to categorical explanatory variables instead of numeric variables, and it is based on very similar assumptions.\nANOVA perform at its best when we have a particular experimental design: a) we divide the population into groups of equal size (balanced design); b) we assign “treatments” to the subjects at random (randomized design); in case of multiple treatment combinations, we perform an experiment for each combination (factorial design); in most cases, we have a “null” treatment (e.g., placebo).\nWe speak of one-way ANOVA when there is a single axis of variation to our treatment (e.g., no intervention, option A, option B), two-way ANOVA when we apply two treatments for each group (e.g., no treatment, Ab, AB, aB), and so forth. Extensions include ANCOVA (ANalysis of COVAriance) and MANOVA (Multivariate ANalysis Of VAriance).\nFor example, we want to test whether a COVID vaccine protects against infection. We can assign at random a population of volunteers to two classes (vaccine/placebo) and contrast the number of people who got sick within 3 months from treatment in the two classes. Of course, we can simply perform a t-test. But what if we assign people to different classes (e.g., M/F, under/over 65 y/o), and want to contrast the mean infection rate across all classes?",

We have divided the samples in \\(k\\) classes of size \\(J_1, \\ldots, J_k\\) such that \\(n=\\sum_i J_i\\). We write an equation for \\(Y_{ij}\\) (the \\(j\\)th observation in group \\(i\\)):\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean; \\(\\mu + \\alpha_i\\) is the mean of group \\(i\\)—we can always choose the parameters such that \\(\\sum_i \\alpha_i = 0\\); and, finally, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the deviation from the group mean. Practically, we are testing whether at least one of the \\(\\alpha_i \\neq 0\\).\nNote that we are making the same assumptions as for linear regression:\n\nThe observations are obtained independently (and randomly) from the population defined by the factor levels (groups)\nThe measurements for each factor level are independent and normally distributed\nThese normal distributions have the same variance\n\n\n\n9.1.2 How one-way ANOVA works\nWe have \\(k\\) groups, and define the overall mean \\(\\bar{y} = \\sum_i \\sum_j Y_{ij} / J_{i}\\), where \\(J_i\\) is the sample size for group \\(i\\). Then the total sum of squared deviations (SSD) is simply:\n\\[\nSSD = \\sum_{i = 1}^k \\sum_{j = 1}^{J_{i}} \\left(Y_{ij} - \\bar{y}\\right)^2\n\\]\nand the associated degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\).

We call the first term in the r.h.s. the between treatment sum of squares (SST) and the second term the within treatment (or residual) ssq (SSE). As such \\(SSD = SST + SSE\\). Similarly, we can decompose SSD as:\n\\[\nSSD = \\sum_{j = 1}^{J_{i}} Y_{ij}^2 - n \\bar{y}^2 = TSS - SSA\n\\] where now TSS is the total sum of squares and SSA is the sum of squares due to the average. Combining the two equations, we can rewrite TSS as the sum of three components:\n\\[\nTSS = SSA + SST + SSE\n\\]\nNote that the degrees of freedom associated with each term are \\(1\\), \\(k-1\\) and \\(n-k\\), respectively.

But which model should you use then?\nThe goal of model selection is to provide you with a disciplined way to choose among competing models. While there is no consensus on a single technique to perform model selection (we will examine some of the alternative paradigms below), all techniques are inspired by Occam’s razor: given models of similar explanatory power, choose the simplest.\nBut what does “simplest” mean? Measuring a model’s “complexity” is far from trivial, hence the different schools of thought. Some approaches simply count the number of free parameters, and penalize models with more parameters; others take into account how much each parameter should be “fine-tuned” to fit the data; other approaches are based on entirely different premises.\nBut why should you choose the simplest model? First, simpler models are easier to analyze, so that for example you could make analytical headway into the mechanics of the process you want to model; simpler models are also considered more beautiful. Second, you want to avoid over-fitting: each biological data set—however carefully crafted—is noisy, and you want to fit the signal, not the noise. If you include too much flexibility in your model, you will get what looks like an excellent fit for the specific data set, but you will be unable to fit other data sets to which your model should also apply.",

    "text": "10.3 Approaches based on maximum-likelihoods\nWe start by examining methods that are based on maximum likelihoods. For each data set and model, you find the best fitting parameters (those maximizing the likelihood). The parameters are said to be at their maximum-likelihood estimate.\n\n10.3.1 Likelihood function\nSome notation:\n\\(D \\to\\) the observed data\n\\(\\theta \\to\\) the free parameter(s) of the statistical model\n\\(L(\\theta \\vert D) \\to\\) the likelihood function, read “the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) given the data”\n\\(\\hat{\\theta} \\to\\) the maximum-likelihood estimates (m.l.e.) of the parameters\n\\(\\mathcal L(\\theta \\vert D) = \\log L(\\theta \\vert D) \\to\\) the log-likelihood\n\\(L(\\hat{\\theta} \\vert D) \\to\\) the maximum likelihood\n\n\n10.3.2 Discrete probability distributions\nThe simplest case is that of a probability distribution function that takes discrete values. Then, the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\) given the data is simply the probability of obtaining the data when parameterizing the model with parameters \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[L(\\theta \\vert x_j) = P(X = x_j; \\theta)\\]\nFinding the m.l.e. of \\(\\theta\\) simply means finding the value(s) maximizing the probability of recovering the data under the model.\n\n\n10.3.3 Continuous probability distributions\nThe definition is more complex for continuous variables (because \\(P(X = x; \\theta) = 0\\) as there are infinitely many values…). What is commonly done is to use the density function \\(f(x; \\theta)\\) and considering the probability of obtaining a value \\(x \\in [x_j, x_j + h]\\), where \\(x_j\\) is our observed data point, and \\(h\\) is small. Then:\n\\[\nL(\\theta \\vert x_j) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{x_j}^{x_j + h} f(x ; \\theta) dx = f(x_j ; \\theta)\n\\] Note that, contrary to probabilities, density values can take values greater than 1. As such, when the dispersion is small, one could end up with values of likelihood greater than 1 (or positive log-likelihoods). In fact, the likelihood function is proportional to but not necessarily equal to the probability of generating the data given the parameters: \\(L(\\theta\\vert X) \\propto P(X; \\theta)\\).\nIn many cases, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the sum of square errors (residuals).",

The two models are usually termed the null model (i.e., the “simpler” model), and the alternative model. The ratio of \\(L_a / L_n\\) tells us how many times more likely the data are under the alternative model vs. the null model. We want to determine whether this ratio is large enough to reject the null model and favor the alternative.\nLikelihood-ratio is especially easy to perform for nested models.\n\n10.5.0.1 Two nested models\nNested means that model \\(\\mathcal M_1\\) has parameters \\(\\theta_1\\), and model \\(\\mathcal M_2\\) has parameters \\(\\theta_2\\), such that \\(\\theta_1 \\in \\theta_2\\) — by setting some of the parameters of \\(\\mathcal M_2\\) to particular values, we recover \\(\\mathcal M_1\\).\nFor example, suppose we want to model the height of trees.

Basically, AIC is measuring (asymptotically) the information loss when using the model in lieu of the actual data. Philosophically, it is rooted in the idea that there is a “true model” that generated the data, and that several possible models can serve as its approximation. Practically, it is very easy to compute:\n\\[AIC = -2 \\mathcal L(\\theta \\vert D) + 2 k\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the number of free parameters (e.g., 3 for the simplest linear regression [intercept, slope, variance of the residuals]).

    "text": "10.8 Bayesian approaches to model selection\nThe approaches we’ve examined before are based on “point-estimates”, i.e., only consider the parameters at their maximum likelihood estimate. Bayesian approaches, on the other hand, consider distributions of parameters. As such, parameters that give high likelihoods for a restricted range of values are deemed “more expensive” (because they are “more important” or need to be “fine-tuned”) than those yielding about the same likelihood for a wide range of values.\n\n10.8.1 Marginal likelihoods\nA very beautiful approach is based on marginal likelihoods, i.e., likelihoods obtained integrating the parameters out. Unfortunately, the calculation becomes difficult to perform by hand for complex models, but it provides a good approach for simple models. In general, we want to assess the “goodness” of a model. Then, using Bayes’ rule:\n\\[\n  P(M\\vert D) = \\frac{P(D\\vert M) P(M)}{P(D)}\n\\]\nWhere \\(P(M\\vert D)\\) is the probability of the model given the data; and \\(P(D)\\) is the “probability of the data” (don’t worry, this need not to be calculated), and \\(P(M)\\) is the prior (the probability that we choose the model before seeing the data). \\(P(D\\vert M)\\) is a marginal likelihood: we cannot compute this directly, because the model requires the parameters \\(\\theta\\), however, we can write\n\\[\nP(D\\vert M) = \\int P(D\\vert M,\\theta)P(\\theta\\vert M) d\\theta\n\\]\nwhere \\(P(D\\vert M,\\theta)\\) is the likelihood, and \\(P(\\theta\\vert M)\\) is a distribution over the parameter values (typically, the priors).\nFor example, let’s compute the marginal likelihood for the case in which we flip a coin \\(n = a + b\\) times, and we obtain \\(a\\) heads and \\(b\\) tails. Call \\(\\theta\\) the probability of obtaining a head, and suppose that \\(P(\\theta\\vert M)\\) is a uniform distribution. Then:\n\\[\nP(a,b\\vert M) = \\int_0^1 P(a,b\\vert M,\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_0^1 \\binom{a+b}{a} \\theta^{a} (1-\\theta)^{b} d\\theta  = \\frac{1}{a+b+1} = \\frac{1}{n+1}\n\\]\nInterestingly, the marginal likelihood can be interpreted as the expected likelihood when parameters are sampled from the prior.\n\n\n10.8.2 Bayes factors\nTake two models, and assume that initially we have no preference \\(P(M_1) = P(M_2)\\), then:\n\\[\n  \\frac{P(M_1\\vert D)}{P(M_2\\vert D)} = \\frac{P(D\\vert M_1)P(M_1)}{P(D\\vert M_2)P(M_2)} = \\frac{P(D\\vert M_1)}{P(D\\vert M_2)}\n\\]\nThe ratio is called the “Bayes factor” and provides a rigorous way to perform model selection.\n\n\n10.8.3 Bayes factors in practice\nIn practice, Bayes Factors can be estimated from MCMC. While we’re not going to get into this here, we can use a package that a) automatically sets the priors for all the variables (close to the philosophy known as “Objective Bayes”); b) performs the calculation of the Bayes Factors for us.\nLet’s build very many models.

While we do not cover it here, you can read about it in [4].\n\n\n10.10.2 Cross validation\nOne very robust method to perform model selection, often used in machine learning, is cross-validation. The idea is simple: split the data in three parts: a small data set for exploring; a large set for fitting; a small set for testing (for example, 5%, 75%, 20%). You can use the first data set to explore freely and get inspired for a good model. These data are then discarded. You use the largest data set for accurately fitting your model(s). Finally, you validate your model or select over competing models using the last data set.\nBecause you haven’t used the test data for fitting, this should dramatically reduce the risk of over-fitting. The downside of this is that we’re wasting precious data. There are less expensive methods for cross validation, but if you have much data, or data is cheap, then this has the virtue of being fairly robust.\n\n10.10.2.1 Exercise: Do shorter titles lead to more citations?\nTo test the power of cross-validation, we are going to examine a bold claim by Letchford et al., 2015: that papers with shorter titles attract more citations than those with longer titles.

If we see the data as points in a high-dimensional space, we can project the data onto a new set of coordinates such that the first coordinate captures the largest share of the variance in the data, the second coordinates captures the largest share of the remaining variance and so on. In this way, we can project large-dimensional data sets onto low-dimensional spaces and lose the least information about the data.\nWe have collected the \\(n \\times m\\) data matrix \\(X\\) (typically, with \\(n \\gg m\\)), in which the rows are samples and the columns are \\(m\\) measures on the samples. Each row of this matrix defines a point in the Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb R^m\\), i.e., each point in this space is a potential sample. Naturally, samples with similar measurements are “close” in this space, and samples that are very different are “far”. However, \\(m\\) can be quite large, and therefore we cannot easily visualize the position of the points. One way to think of PCA is as the best projection of the points in a \\(r\\)-dimensional space (with \\(r \\leq m\\)), for visualization and clustering.\nFor example, take the iris data set:\nWe can separate the clusters better by finding the best projection in 2D:",

    "text": "11.2 Singular Value Decomposition\nAt the hearth of PCA is a particular matrix decomposition (or factorization): we represent the matrix \\(X\\) as a product of other matrices (or, equivalently, a sum of matrices). In particular, SVD is defined by the equation:\n\\[\nX = U \\Sigma V^T\n\\]\n\\(X\\) is a \\(n \\times m\\) matrix, \\(U\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) orthogonal, unitary matrix and \\(V\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) orthogonal, unitary matrix, and \\(\\Sigma\\) is a \\(m \\times n\\) rectangular, diagonal matrix with non-negative values on the diagonal. If \\(V\\) is a (real) unitary matrix, then \\(VV^T = I_m\\) (the \\(m \\times m\\) identity matrix), and if \\(U\\) is also unitary, then \\(UU^T = I_n\\). Another way to put this is \\(U^{-1} = U^T\\).\n(Note: this defines the “full” SVD of \\(A\\); equivalently, one can perform a “thin”, or “reduced” SVD by having \\(U\\) of dimension \\(n \\times p\\), and \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(V\\) of dimension \\(p \\times p\\), where \\(p \\leq m\\) is the rank of \\(A\\)—by default R returns a “thin” SVD; read the details here).\nThe values on the diagonal of \\(\\Sigma\\) are the singular values of \\(X\\), i.e., the nonzero eigenvalues of \\(XX^T\\) (or \\(X^T X\\)). In this context, the matrix \\(U\\) contains the left singular vectors of \\(X\\) and \\(V\\) its right singular vectors. Let’s rearrange the rows/cols of \\(\\Sigma\\), \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) such that we have the singular values in decreasing order: \\(\\text{diag}(\\Sigma) = (\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_m)\\).\nThrough SVD, the matrix \\(X\\) can be seen as a sum of \\(m\\) matrices:\n\\[\nX = \\sum_{i = 1}^m U_i \\Sigma_{ii} V_i^T = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \\ldots\n\\]\nWhere \\(U_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th column of \\(U\\). Most importantly, you can prove that at each step (\\(r\\)), you are computing the “best” approximation of \\(X\\) as a sum of \\(r\\) rank-1 matrices. I.e., for each \\(r\\) we have that \\(\\| X - (X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_r) \\|\\) is as small as possible (Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem).\nLet’s look at a concrete example.

    "text": "11.3 SVD and PCA\nLet’s go back to our data matrix \\(X\\), and its representation as \\(n\\) points (the samples) in \\(m\\) dimensions (the measurements). For the moment, consider the case in which each column of \\(X\\) sums to zero (i.e., for each measurement, we have removed the mean—this is called “centering”). We would like to represent the data as best as possible in few dimensions, such that a) the axes are orthogonal; b) the axes are aligned with the principal sources of variation in the data. More precisely, PCA is an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the direction of greatest variance of the data is aligned with the first coordinate, the second greatest with the second coordinate, and so on.\nFor example, let’s take the Petal.Lenght and Petal.Width in iris:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can see that now the points are centered at (0,0).\nIn practice, we want to produce a new “data matrix” \\(Y\\):\n\\[\nY = XW\n\\]\nwhere \\(W\\) is an appropriate change of basis, transforming the data such that the directions of main variation are exposed. While we could choose any \\(m \\times m\\) matrix, we want a) \\(W\\) to be orthogonal (i.e., a “rotation” of the data), and b) all columns of \\(W\\) to be unit vectors (no stretching of the data).\nThe new columns (i.e., the transformed “measurements”) \\(Y_i\\) can be written as:\n\\[\nY_{i} = X W_i\n\\]\nWhere \\(Y_i\\) is the ith column of \\(Y\\) and \\(W_i\\) the ith column on \\(W\\). Let’s start with the first column \\(Y_1\\): we want to choose \\(W_1\\) such that the variance of \\(Y_i\\) is maximized. Because the mean of each column of \\(X\\) is zero, then also the mean of \\(Y_i\\) is zero. Thus, the variance is simply \\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{j =1}^{n} Y_{ij}^2 =\\frac{1}{n-1} \\|Y_i\\|\\). We can write this is matrix form:\n\\[\\frac{1}{n-1}\\|Y_i\\| = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\|XW_i \\| = \\frac{1}{n-1} W_i^TX^T X W_i\\]\nNote that \\(S = \\frac{1}{n-1} X^T X\\) is the \\(m \\times m\\) sample covariance matrix of \\(X\\). Because \\(\\|W_i\\| = 1\\), we can rewrite this as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n}\\|Y_i\\| = \\frac{W_i^T S W_i}{W_i^T W_i}\n\\]\nWhich is maximized (over \\(W_i\\)) when \\(W_i\\) is the eigenvector of \\(S\\) associated with the largest eigenvalue (see the Rayleigh quotient), in which case:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n-1}\\|Y_i\\| = \\frac{W_i^T S W_i}{W_i^T W_i} = \\lambda_1\n\\]\nTherefore, the first column of \\(Y\\) is given by the projection of the data on the first eigenvector of \\(S\\). The variance captured by this first axis is given by the largest eigenvalue of \\(S\\). To find the other columns of \\(Y\\), you can subtract from \\(X\\) the matrix \\(Y_1 W_1^T\\) and repeat.\nNote that the first axis captures \\(\\lambda_1 / \\sum_{i = 1}^m \\lambda_i\\) of the total variance in \\(X\\). This is typically reported in PCA as the “loadings” of the various components.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTherefore, PCA amounts to simply taking the eigenvectors of \\(S\\) ordered by the corresponding eigenvalues. We can use the SVD to accomplish this task efficiently:\n\\[\nX = U \\Sigma V^T\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S = X^T X &= (V \\Sigma^T U^T) (U \\Sigma V^T)\\\\\n&= V \\Sigma^T \\Sigma V^T\\\\\n&= V \\widetilde{\\Sigma}^2 V^T\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\widetilde{\\Sigma}^2 = \\Sigma^T \\Sigma\\) (or, equivalently the square of the square version of \\(\\Sigma\\)). But contrasting \\(S = W \\Lambda W^T\\) and \\(S = V (\\widetilde{\\Sigma}^2 / (m-1))V^T\\) we see that \\(V = W\\). Finally, we have:\n\\[\nY = X W = U \\Sigma V^T V = U\\Sigma\n\\]\nTherefore, we can perform PCA efficiently by decomposing \\(X\\) using SVD.\n\n11.3.1 PCA in R—from scratch\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nPretty good!

This type of approach is called unsupervised learning and it is appropriate when the “truth” for your data classification is unavailable or difficult to obtain.\nIf the truth is unknown, we need a way of deciding which data points belong together. One common set of approaches relies on a measure of closeness, or distance between points. Of those, the classic K-means approach is the most straightforward.\nLet us apply the k-means algorithm to our well-studied penguin data set. In the script below, we remove the NAs, and select out the categorical variables, as they are not directly useful for the distance-based algorithm, leaving the four numeric variables to define similarity between individuals. The question is, will they cluster penguins according to species?t\nThe plot is produced by performing PCA to reduce the number of variables from 4 to 2, helping present the data points in the way that optimizes their visual separation. Notice that the clusters are not well separated, and when compared with the actual classification given by species, they do not do well.\nHowever, the four measurements have very different variances, so we try scaling them to make them all have equal variance of one:\nNow we get much better separation, as well as much better prediction quality. However, if you run the above code several times, you will see different results, because k-means starts with a random selection of centroids. In cases like this, where there is not very obvious clusters, it may converge to different classifications. Here, for some trials we see very good prediction quality for all three species, but other times two of the species are commingled.",

In many cases, however:\n\nthe response variable does not have support in the whole real line (e.g., binary, count, only positive values)\nthe errors are not normally distributed (e.g., the response variable can take only positive values)\nthe variance changes with the mean (heteroscedasticity)\n\nIn these cases, you can use Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to fit the data. In the simplest form of GLMs,\n\nThe response variable is modeled by a single-parameter distribution from the exponential family (Gaussian, Gamma, Binomial, Poisson, etc.)\nA link function linearizes the relationship between the fitted values and the predictors.\nParameters are estimated through a least squares algorithm.\n\n\n13.2.1 Model structure\nIn practice, we need to determine three parts of the model:\n\nRandom component the entries of the response variable (\\(Y\\)) are assumed to be independently drawn from a certain distribution (e.g., Binomial)—typically a distribution that can be modeled using a single parameter.\nSystematic component the explanatory variables (\\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(\\ldots\\)) are combined linearly to form a linear predictor (e.g., \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\ldots\\)).

    "text": "13.4 Count data\n\n13.4.1 Poisson regression\nSuppose your response variables are non-negative integers. For example, we are counting the number of eggs females lay as a function of their age, body size, etc. A possible model for this case is to think of the response variable as being sampled from a Poisson distribution:\n\\[\nY_i \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_i)\n\\]\nand that the logarithm of the parameter \\(\\lambda_i\\) depends linearly on the predictors:\n\\[\n\\mathbb E[\\lambda_i] = \\mathbb E[\\log(Y_i|X_i)] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\n\\]\nIn this case, our link function is the logarithm, transforming the relationship between the fitted values and the predictors into a linear regression.\n\n\n13.4.2 Exercise in class: Number of genomes\nThe file data/genomes.csv contains the year in which the genome of a given animal was published. The file sequence_cost.csv the estimated cost per sequencing a Mb in a given year.\n\nCount the number of genomes published per year (store the value as n) and store it in the tibble num_genomes along with the values Year and Dollars_per_Mb (note: you need to use inner_join to pull this off);\nFit the number of genomes published in a given year:\n\nusing only an intercept (your predictions should match the mean) (Code: pois_1 &lt;- glm(n ~ 1, data = num_genomes, family = \"poisson\"))\nusing the year as a predictor\nusing the cost of sequencing as a predictor\n\nFor each model, plot the observed n vs its predicted value, and compute AIC. Is the fit superior when we use Year or Dollars_per_Mb?\n\n\n\n13.4.3 Underdispersed and Overdispersed data\nThe main feature of the Poisson distribution is that the mean and the variance are both equal to \\(\\lambda\\). You might remember (Taylor expansion) that:\n\\[\ne^x = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}\n\\]\nThen, for \\(X\\) sampled from a Poisson distribution:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb E[X] &= \\sum_{x = 0}^{\\infty} x P(X = x) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{x = 0}^{\\infty} x e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!} \\\\\n&= \\lambda e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{(x - 1) = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\lambda^{(x-1)}}{(x-1)!} \\\\\n&= \\lambda e^{-\\lambda}e^{\\lambda} \\\\\n&= \\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSimilarly, using\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb V[X] &= \\mathbb E[X^2]-\\mathbb E[X]^2\\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_{x = 0}^{\\infty} x^2 e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^x}{x!} \\right) - \\lambda^2 \\\\\n&= \\ldots\\\\\n&= \\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe fact that the variance equals the mean is a hard constraint, rarely matched by real data. When you encounter over-dispersion (i.e., the variance in the data is much larger than what assumed by Poisson), you need to choose a different model. This happens very often, and the main solution to use is a Negative Binomial Regression (a negative binomial distribution can be thought of as a Poisson with a scaled variance). In practice, this amounts to fitting:\n\\[\n\\mathbb E[\\lambda_i] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\n\\] and\n\\[\n\\mathbb E[\\lambda_i^2] - \\mathbb E[\\lambda_i]^2 = \\mathbb V[\\lambda_i] = \\phi \\lambda_i\n\\] Where \\(\\phi\\) controls the dispersion of the data. A value \\(\\phi &gt; 1\\) signals over-dispersion, while (the very rare case of) \\(\\phi &lt; 1\\) under-dispersion. The Poisson regression is appropriate only when \\(\\phi \\approx 1\\). A simple way to test for dispersion in to fit a quasipoisson model, which returns a dispersion parameter (anything larger than 1 means over-dispersion).\n\n\n13.4.4 Exercise in class: Number of genomes\n\nFor the models above, change the family to quasipoisson to check the dispersion (e.g., qpois_1 &lt;- glm(n ~ 1, data = num_genomes, family = \"quasipoisson\")).\nDo you have over-dispersion?\nIf the data are over-dispersed, fit them again using glm.nb (a negative binomial regression model provided by the package MASS).\n\n\n\n13.4.5 Separate distribution for the zeros\nIn several biologically-relevant cases, we have an excess of zeros. For example, you might have animals, that, if they reach the age of 1, will go on to a live a number of years—say well-described by a Poisson distribution. However, mortality immediately after birth is high. In such cases, you can use zero-inflated or zero-hurdle models.\nIn zero-inflated models, you can think of having a conditional branching: with probability \\(p_z\\) your count is zero; if not (prob. \\(1-p_z\\)) it is sampled from a given distribution. As such a count of zero can stem from two different processes: either because you got a zero at the first step, or because you have sampled a zero from the distribution.\nZero-hurdle models are slightly different: you first decide whether you’re going to have a zero; if not, you sample your data from a truncated distribution, such that you cannot sample a zero from this second source.\nZero-inflated and zero-hurdle models are examples of mixture models.",

    "text": "14.2 Naive Bayes classifier\nSuppose that we wish to classify an observation into one of K classes, which means there is a response variable Y can take on K different values, or labels. Let \\(π_k\\) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen observation comes from the k-th class. Let \\(f_k(X) =Pr(X|Y = k)\\) be the density function of X for an observation that comes from the k-th class.\nAssuming we have the prior probabilities and the conditional probability distributions of the observations within each category \\(k\\), we can use Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability of each class, given a set of observations \\(x\\) by turning around the conditionality:\n\\[\nP(Y = k | X = x) = \\frac{\\pi_k f_k(x)}{\\sum_i^K \\pi_i f_i(x)}\n\\] And let us use the notation \\(p_k (x) = P(Y = k | X = x)\\) to mean the posterior probability that an observation \\(x\\) belongs to class \\(k\\).\nLet us use the penguin data as an example, where we want to classify the observations by species. Then, if we take a training set with known classifications, we can take the prior probabilities \\(\\pi_k\\) to be the fractions of observed birds of each species, and the probability distributions of each explanatory variable for each species \\(f_k(X)\\) can be estimated from the observed distributions of the explanatory variables (flipper lengths, etc.) for Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap subsets of observations.\nThe difficult part in the above example is estimating the distributions \\(f_k(X)\\), which is especially challenging for joint distributions of multiple variables. One method, called Linear Discriminant Analysis, assumes the distributions have the same covariance matrices for all classes and only differ in their mean values. Another, called Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, assumes different covariance matrices for different classes.\nThe Naive Bayes classifier instead assumes that within each class the explanatory variables \\(X_i\\) are independent, and thus\n\\[\nf_k(x) = f_{k1} (x_1) \\times f_{k2} (x_2) \\times ... \\times f_{kn} (x_n)\n\\]\nwhere \\(f_{ki}(x_i)\\) is the probability distribution of the i-th explanatory variable \\(x_i\\) for class \\(k\\).\nThis modifies the Bayes’ formula to look like this:\n\\[\nP(Y = k | X = x) = \\frac{\\pi_k f_{k1} (x_1) \\times f_{k2} (x_2) \\times ... \\times f_{kn} (x_n)}{\\sum_i^K \\pi_i f_{k1} (x_1) \\times f_{k2} (x_2) \\times ... \\times f_{kn} (x_n)}\n\\]Although it looks more complicated, we can compute each distribution function separately, so as long as there is enough data in the training set to estimate each explanatory variable for each class, the calculation is manageable.\n\n14.2.1 Naive Bayes penguin example\nHere is an example of using tidymodels for classification using Naive Bayes.\nFirst, we load and clean the data, then split the observations into training and test sets.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe then define a model specification using the parsnip package.

This can be represented by a decision tree, whose internal nodes are separators of the space of observations (all the values of explanatory variables) that divide it into regions, and the leaves are the labels of these regions. (Decision trees can also be used for quantitative response variables, but we will focus on classification.) For example, here is a a decision tree for accepting a job offer:\n\n\n\nShould you take this job? (from https://365datascience.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/decision-trees)\n\n\nBuilding a decision tree for classification happens by sequential splitting the space of observations, starting with the decision that gives the most bang for the buck. Let us define the quality of the split into \\(M\\) region by calculating how many observations in that regions actually belong to each category \\(k\\). The Gini index (or impurity) is defined as the product of the probability of an observation (in practice, the fraction of observations in the training set) being labeled correctly with label \\(k\\) (\\(p_k\\)) times the probability of it being labeled incorrectly (\\(1-p_k\\)), summed over all the labels \\(k\\):\n\\[\nG = \\sum_k (1-p_k)p_k\n\\]\nAlternatively, one can use the Shannon information or entropy measure:\n\\[\nS = -\\sum_k p_k log(p_k)\n\\]\nNotice that both measures are smallest when \\(p_k\\) is close to 1 or 0, so they both tell the same story for a particular region: if (almost) all the points are points are either classified or incorrectly, these measures are close to 0.\n\n\n\nRecursive splitting of a two-dimensional set of observations (from https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)\n\n\nOne of these measures is used to create the sequential splits in the training data set. The biggest problem with this decision tree method is that it’s a greedy algorithm that easily leads to overfitting: as you can see in the figure above, it can create really complicated regions in the observation space that may not correspond to meaningful distinctions.\n\n14.3.1 Penguin data\nDefine the model specifications for decision trees:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCreate a recipe, apply the model and fit it on the training set:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nPredict the classification for the test set and validate the predictions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nMake a plot of the best-fit decision tree:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n14.3.2 Breast cancer data\nUsing the same model tree_spec, create a recipe, apply the model and fit it on the training set:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nPredict the classification for the test set and validate the predictions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nMake a plot of the best-fit decision tree:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

This gave rise to the idea to “shake up” the algorithm and see if the splits it produces are robust if the training set is different. In fact, let’s use multiple trees and look at what the consensus of the ensemble can produce. This approach is called bagging, which makes use of an random ensemble of parallel classifiers, each of which over-fits the data, it combines the results to find a better classification. An ensemble of randomized decision trees is known as a random forest.\nEssentially, the process is as follows: use random sampling from the data set (bootstrapping) to generate different training sets and train different decision trees on each. Then for each observation, find its consensus classification among the whole ensemble; that is, how does the plurality of the trees classify it.\nSince each data point is left out of a number of trees, one can estimate an unbiased error of classification by computing the “out-of-bag” error: for each observation, used the classification produced by all the trees that did not have this one points in the bag.

In 1989, the MN DNR instituted a slot limit of 22–30 inches in this lake (i.e., all caught fish within this size interval had to be released). We consider length data from 73 and 81 fish collected in trap nets in 1988 and 1993, respectively (before and after the fishing regulation was put in place). Importantly, these data come from only one lake, and many other factors may have changed between 1988 and 1993. Therefore, we must be cautious when interpreting any changes in the distribution of fish sizes (i.e., attributing the cause of length changes to the management regulation or generalizing results to other lakes). Nonetheless, we can ask, “How much did fish length, on average, change between 1988 and 1993 in Medicine Lake?” To address this question, we estimate the difference in the mean length of fish in the two samples. We also quantify our uncertainty in this estimated difference in means, recognizing that we would get a different estimate if we could go back and collect other samples of fish in those 2 years.\n\nLet’s read the data\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd divide it by year\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nShowing that fish in 1993 were 2.6 inches longer.

    "text": "15.5 Hypothesis testing using Monte Carlo\nThese methods are often used when we can easily sample from the null model (i.e., a model encoding the null hypothesis), and we want to compute some statistics on the observed data v. the randomized data. We can associate an “empirical” p-value to the test, by measuring how often the statistics on the randomized data exceeds that measured for the empirical data.\n\n15.5.1 Example: penguin breeding pairs\nThis example is taken from Graeme Ruxton & Markus Neuhäuser (“Improving the reporting of P-values generated by randomization methods”, Methods in Eco & Evol 2013).\n\nMassaro & Blair (New Zealand J. Ecol, 2003) wanted to compare the numbers of breeding yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) on Stewart Island off New Zealand with those on nearby islands, which (unlike Stewart Island) had no feral cats (Felis catus) that are potential predators of the penguins. They visited 19 breeding colonies on Stewart island and recorded the following numbers of breeding pairs at them {7,3,3,7,3,7,3,10,1,7,4,1,3,2,1,2,9,4,2}, and 10 colonies on nearby islands where the recorded numbers of pairs were {15,32,1,13,14,11,1,3,2,7}. Thus, in total, 178 breeding pairs were observed; on Stewart Island, the mean colony size (±SE) was 4.2 (±0.6), whereas on other islands, it was 9.9 (±3). We want to explore by randomization whether this sample gives reason for rejecting the null hypothesis that each pair chooses a breeding site (independently) without regard to the presence of cats. […] Given the noticeably lower variability among colony sizes on Stewart Island, an appropriate test statistic to adopt might be the t statistic for samples with unequal variance (Ruxton 2006). For each randomization, each of the 178 pairs independently chooses one of the 29 colonies (each with equal probability).\n\nIn a nutshell, the idea is to\n\nmeasure the t statistics for the observed data\nrepeatedly generate randomized data by assigning the 178 pairs to the colonies at random\nmeasure the t statistics for the randomized data, forming a distribution\ncompute the (empirical) probability of finding a value for the randomized data that is larger than that found for the observed data\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this case, we have observed a larger (or equal) value 61 times out of 999 randomizations. The last step is to divide this number by the number of simulations, to obtain a probability. There are two ways to do this:\n\\[\np = \\frac{\\sum_i{I(x_i \\geq X})}{n}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_i\\) is the statistics for randomization \\(i\\), \\(X\\) is the statistics for the observed data, and \\(n\\) is the number of randomizations. In this case:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, and slightly more conservatively, we can assume that the empirical data was also sampled from the null model, in which case:\n\\[\np = \\frac{1+ \\sum_i{I(x_i \\geq X})}{n + 1}\n\\]\nyielding:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe difference between the two approaches is largest when the probability of observing a large value in the randomizations is very small (in one case we would get \\(0\\), in the other \\(1/(n+1)\\)). Ruxton & Neuhäuser recommend stating the choice explicitly, to improve replicability. A discussion of this issue in the field of genetics can be found in North et al. (“A Note on the Calculation of Empirical P Values from Monte Carlo Procedures”, Am J Hum Genet 2002); Gandy (“Sequential implementation of Monte Carlo Tests with uniformly bounded resampling risk” Journal of the American Statistical Association 2000) provides an algorithm to compute confidence intervals on the empirical p-value.\nNaturally, the larger the number of simulations, the more accurate the result. The rule of thumb is that one would need about \\(10^4\\) randomizations to be confident in the first two decimals.",

    "text": "15.6 Randomizing binary tables (bipartite networks)\nOften, biological data is represented by binary, rectangular tables. For example:\n\nRows are sampling sites, and columns are species; a 1 marks the presence of a species at a site, and a 0 its absence.\nRows are individuals and columns are SNPs.\nRows are species and columns are traits.\nRows are genes and columns are times; a 1 marks genes that are significantly over-expressed at a given time.\n…\n\nThese data can be represented as either a binary, rectangular matrix, or equivalently as a bipartite network.\nOne of the most salient feature of such a table is given by its marginal totals (row/col sums, or the degree of the nodes in the bipartite network). The marginal totals/degrees greatly influence the network/table structure. For example, in extreme cases there is only one binary table/network with a given set of degrees.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n15.6.1 Randomizing the network: checkerboard swapping\nIf we can identify two rows and two columns such that the induced submatrix is\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\nA\n0\n1\n\n\nB\n1\n0\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\nA\n1\n0\n\n\nB\n0\n1\n\n\n\nwe can swap the submatrix for the other, without altering the row/col marginal totals.\n\n\n15.6.2 Randomizing the network: curveball\nThe same idea can be generalized. One fun way to think about this, introduced by Strona et al. (“A fast and unbiased procedure to randomize ecological binary matrices with fixed row and column totals” Nature Comm 2014) is to consider children exchanging baseball cards. In the example above, the cards are the columns and the children are the rows, and two children exchange one card (for example, A does not have card b, and B does not have card a; if they exchange them the number of cards per child and the number of children per card are unchanged).\nTake two rows of a binary matrix:\n\n\n\n\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\n\n\n\n\nA\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nB\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\nThe intersection set \\(A \\cap B\\) is given by {a,c,d,f,g}, with A contributing two “cards” (d, f) and B contributing three (a,c,g). If we pool all the cards in the intersection, and then A picks two at random, and B the remaining three, the marginals are unchanged.\nClearly, the “mixing” of the table is faster, because we can trade several cards at once. It can be proven that, after a sufficiently large number of trades, the resulting table/network is sampled uniformly from the set of tables/networks with the given marginal totals.\nFor example, create a random binary table, and shuffle it keeping the marginal totals:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n15.6.3 Example: Darwin’s finches\nJared Diamond proposed that the presence/absence of species on islands would be influenced by competition: bird species would try avoiding overlapping with their competitors, and would tend to co-occur with species they are not competing with. While this idea generated a very contentious debate, here we are going to test this hypothesis using the famous Darwin’s finches (see Weiner, The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time 1994), using a metric proposed by Roberts and Stone. Take \\(A\\) to be a matrix with the \\(m\\) finch species as rows, and \\(n\\) islands as columns; a 1 marks the presence of a finch species on an island. The matrix \\(S = A A^T\\) counts the number of islands in which species co-occur. Naturally, the diagonal reports the number of islands in which a finch species is found.\nRoberts and Stone proposed to measure:\n\\[\n\\bar{S^2} = \\frac{1}{m (m-1)} \\sum_{i\\neq j}S_{ij}^2\n\\]\nThis number is small if finch species do not co-occurr often, and is high when some species always co-occur. We are going to use the curveball algorithm to randomize the species data, and then compute an empirical p value for the probability of observing this result by chance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nwe conclude that our null model (finches choose random islands, considering that some fiches are more widespread than others, and that some islands harbor a larger number of species) would not generate such a high value by chance with high probability, and thus we reject the hypothesis.",

There is a special R structure for storing and operating on time series, called ts, as illustrated here:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis reads in a data set recording the number of births per month in New York City, from 1946 to 1958 (in thousands of births?) To create the time series, we had to give the function the frequency, or the number of time points in a year, and the starting value as a vector assigned to start = c(1946, 1), the first element is the year and the second the month.\nThere are several other specialized data structures for handling time series. We will use one from a new set of R packages called tidyverts that is called a tsibble. https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/ The tsibbledata package contains several time series data sets and we will load two below: olympic_running, containing the Olympic winning times in different running events, and pelt, containing the classic data of the number of Lynx and Hare pelts sold in Canada in the 19th and early 20th centuries:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can see that tsibbles contain multiple variables, one of which is the time variable and is called the index, and one or more others are denoted as key, which are variables that identify the observations but are not changing in time.

    "text": "16.3 Decomposition of time series\nAs you can see from the plots above, time series are often a combination of different time-dependent processes and it is often useful to think about them separately. One can distinguish three types of time variation in time series:\n\n\nSeasonality A seasonal pattern occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. Seasonality is always of a fixed and known frequency.\nTrend A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes we will refer to a trend as “changing direction”, when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.\nCyclic A cycle occurs when the data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency. In economics, these fluctuations may by due to economic conditions and are often related to the “business cycle”.\n\n\n\n16.3.1 Decomposition of time series\nThere are two main types of decompositions of time series: additive and multiplicative. Let us call \\(X_t\\) the time series data, \\(T_t\\) the trend (non-periodic component), \\(S_t\\) the seasonal part (periodic component), and \\(R_t\\) the remainder.\n\\[\nX_t = T_t + S_t + R_t\n\\] \\[\nX_t = T_t \\times S_t \\times R_t\n\\]\nOne simple way of removing seasonality and estimating the trend is using the moving average, that is using \\(k\\) points before and \\(k\\) points after each point to calculate the trend: \\[\nT_t =  \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=-k}^k X_{t+i}\n\\]\nHere \\(m\\) is called the order of the moving average and is defined as \\(m = 2k+1\\). There is a useful function ma() that calculates these averages and allows them to be plotted.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercise: Change the moving average window and see if you can make seasonality (periodicity) vanish!\nAn even order of periodicity requires an asymmetric averaging window, so to create an symmetric average, one can repeat the moving average of order two on the already-averaged data.\n\n\n16.3.2 Classic decomposition:\nAdditive decomposition [1]:\n\nIf m is an even number, compute the trend-cycle component \\(T_t\\) using a 2×m-MA. If m is an odd number, compute the trend-cycle component \\(\\hat T_t\\) using an m-MA.\nCalculate the detrended series: \\(X_t - \\hat T_t\\)\nTo estimate the seasonal component for each season, average the detrended values for that season. For example, with monthly data, the seasonal component for March is the average of all the detrended March values in the data. These seasonal component values are then adjusted to ensure that they add to zero. The seasonal component is obtained by stringing together these monthly values, and then replicating the sequence for each year of data. This gives \\(\\hat S_t\\).\nThe remainder component is calculated by subtracting the estimated seasonal and trend-cycle components: \\(\\hat R_t = X_t - \\hat T_t - \\hat S_t\\)\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis simple classical decomposition has numerous flaws, so better, more modern methods are preferred. In particular, it assumes a constant seasonal term, it tends to over-estimate the variation in the trend, it misses data for the first few and last few data points, and can be sensitive to outliers.\n\n\n16.3.3 STL decomposition\nA more robust method is called the STL decomposition (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess). To summarize its advantages [1]:\n\nSTL can handle any type of seasonality, not only monthly and quarterly data.\nThe seasonal component is allowed to change over time, and the rate of change can be controlled by the user.\nThe smoothness of the trend-cycle can also be controlled by the user.\nIt can be robust to outliers (i.e., the user can specify a robust decomposition), so that occasional unusual observations will not affect the estimates of the trend-cycle and seasonal components. They will, however, affect the remainder component.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercise: Apply the two decomposition methods to the pelt time series data.",

One simple way is to calculate the Pearson correlation between different time series, called the cross-correlation (where \\(\\bar X\\) stands for the mean of X and \\(\\text{Var}(X)\\) stands for the variance of \\(X\\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Cor}(X,Y) = \\frac{\\sum_t (\\bar X - X_t)(\\bar Y - Y_t)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)}}\n\\]\nIn a data set with multiple variables it can be handy to examine the cross-correlations between all pairs between them. Here’s a convenient function to both calculate and visualize it for multiple variables, in this case the hotel visitor nights for the 5 different regions of NSW. The plot below show the scatter plots of all the pairs of time series against each other, along with the respective correlation coefficients:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHowever, sometimes the straightforward correlation may miss or underestimate a relationship that is obviously there, but with a delay.

The relationship is strongly positive at lags 4 and 8, reflecting the strong seasonality in the data.\nThis suggests that there is a strong similarity between the time series and itself, shifted by certain time values. This is described by the autocorrelation, which is defined as a function of the lag \\(k\\):\n\\[\nr(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{t=k}^T (\\bar X - X_t)(\\bar X - X_{t-k})}{\\text{Var}(X)}\n\\]\nThe autocorrelation can be calculated and plotted for our example of the visitation nights in New South Wales:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn both cases, the lag plots are closest to the diagonal identity line for lag of 9 or 10. This should be reflected in the autocorrelation plot:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice the periodicity in the autocorrelation, which indicated periodicity in the time series.\nAutocorrelation measures the memory of a signal - for example, pure white noise is uncorrelated with itself even a moment later, and thus has no memory. As such, it is very useful as a measure of a trend in the data - if the time series has slowly decaying, positive autocorrelation, that indicates a pronounced trend, while periodicity indicates seasonality in the data.\nExercise: Use the lag and autocorrelation analysis to describe the patterns in the time series of births in NYC.\n\n\n16.4.3 Perennial warning: correlations are not causation!\nThese two data sets, on Australian air passengers and rice production in Guinea, have a very strong positive correlation:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHowever, notice that the residuals indicate a strong trend, which violates the assumptions of linear regression.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are a number of fun examples of spurious time series correlations in reference [5].",
